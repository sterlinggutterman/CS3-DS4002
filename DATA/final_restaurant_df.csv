0,2023-02-19,5.0,"This place was better than the 3 Michelin-star restaurant I ate at in NYC last week (not naming names). They've only been open only 3 days and already seem to have everything on lock. We had an ""early bird special"" reservation at 5PM on a Saturday and were greeted by a lovely host and seated immediately. I'm pretty sure the Guardians of the Galaxy station was what was playing on the speakers (that alone gives extra points ;)). Our server, Zoe, was perfectly attentive and super knowledgeable about the available cuts of meats. The menu was very diverse for the entrees however the only gripe I have is that the starters were limited. We ordered the roasted oysters to start and OMG the BEST roasted oysters I've ever had. They were cooked to perfection and super tender. My husband and I shared the ribeye and ordered the Raymond Sauce and Chimichurri for side sauces. We loved both so much that we're still in the octagon to decide the winner ;). The ribeye was amazingly flavorful, and the sauces were a lovely accouterment but seriously not even needed due to the quality of the meat and the perfection of the cooking/seasoning. The steak comes with a house salad and baguette that arrives before your entree. We also ordered the creamed spinach which was another ""best"". Seriously. Not too creamy/heavy, just overall DELICIOUS. Our server was the perfect amount of checking in and making suggestions. Oh and did I mention they have a super knowledgeable sommelier and a delightful wine list. We also ordered dessert with the french press coffee. I'm not a dessert person, but the lemon pie was chef's kiss.  

All in all, we will definitely be back and can't wait to try all the other delicious sounding items on the menu.",82.0,Black Cow,0.9965,Sunday
1,2023-02-19,5.0,"I have to say, this place is a steakhouse like no other, best beef and my bone in pork chop and sauce was fabulous. We sat up at the bar and Danny & Emily took care of us at every beckon request. I do feel that this place is a diamond in the rough, it should be the place for beef, pork & chicken. Love the atmosphere, staff, cooks & owner Dan! Thank you!",113.0,Black Cow,0.9674,Sunday
2,2023-02-26,5.0,"Loved this place! They were completely booked but they squeezed us in in the lounge. Thank you! This restaurant was just what we were looking for on our short visit from CA.
Steak was awesome. Shared the Chateaubriand and my son had the ribeye (both with butter on top.) steaks came with dinner salad and sourdough bread.
Mashers were super rich and delicious. Brussels sprouts were crispy and flavorful.  Desserts- lemon pie (like a lemon square as it had shortbread crust), vanilla ice cream and chocolate mousse (if you like dark chocolate) all were awesome too.  Service was excellent.
Make a reservation in advance.",28.0,Black Cow,0.9937,Sunday
3,2023-05-03,4.0,"Food is excellent, best steak in a very long time. Service was excellent, attentive, helpful but not overbearing.  Ambiance was eating in a very loud garage, so only reason it was not a solid 5 star.",24.0,Black Cow,0.7604,Wednesday
4,2023-08-03,5.0,"The food here is incredible! The service was extremely friendly and helpful. We felt right at home and very well accommodated. 

I will say, the height of the booths along the back wall is *extremely* uncomfortable and overall, fairly inaccessible if one has any sort of limitation mobility-wise. Initially we were seated there. The tables were awkwardly high for the height of the seats (which was already not great), and the edge of the table was up to my chest which made it hard to comfortably eat. However, our server was able to move us into a normal height table when he saw that all of the people in our party were struggling. Another thing to note is that the restaurant is fairly loud. This didn't bother me much, but I can imagine that if one is sensitive to that it could be bothersome. Just something to note if one is seeking a quieter dining experience. This place is full of life!

The food was AMAZING. Delicious wood fired oysters, steaks with flavor-packed compound butter and optional sauces, delightfully crispy fries, and perfectly cooked vegetables. The drinks were delightful as well. I thoroughly look forward to coming back!!",23.0,Black Cow,0.9845,Thursday
5,2023-03-19,5.0,"Wow! Mouth watering steak (excuse the spilled Bernaise sauce). Tender, perfectly cooked filet. Others at the rib end tomahawk, Berkshire pork chop, and New York strip.  No one shared because our meals were too good! For wides we did mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and Brussels sprouts.  The creamed spinach was gone.  The Brussels sprouts were the kind you think about the next day and crave.  The potatoes were good. Extensive wine list and full bar.  Everything is a La carte though so it added up.  Entrees come with a salad but no other sides.  There's also bread service.  10/10 highly recommend if you're looking for a nice night out.  The food is delicious!!!!",165.0,Black Cow,0.9428,Sunday

7,2023-03-23,5.0,The food was absolutely delicious. I had a perfectly cooked ribeye with the chimichuri sauce and the truffle mac and cheese. It was fantastic! I'd also recommend the cocktails (Smoky Dove with jalapeno salt ring! Yum!) The happy hour was a great price for all that deliciousness..,2.0,Black Cow,0.9757,Thursday
8,2023-03-29,5.0,Five represents excellent service & food! The old service station has great warm weather seating outside but it was still spring cool and we ate inside. The service was excellent and the food was great--great burgers with local beef and salad or fries. Even better steak plates ...our group had two burgers and two steak plates--outstanding local beef as good as it is going to get on this planet if one eats meat.,1.0,Black Cow,0.9696,Wednesday
9,2023-08-04,4.0,"Good, but still not the best steak in town. 

Stopped in here for an early dinner. Both my fiancé and I ordered the Steak Frites from the Happy Hour Menu. I added the salad with the cherry vinaigrette to mine. The salad was really good! Not sweet, a nice flavor. They had also brought us bread and that was good as well. 

For drinks, my fiancé got the Walnut Old Fashioned. It was very sweet, which the waiter had warned us about, but we both agreed it would have made a better dessert drink than meal drink. I had a couple glasses of the Malbec which was really nice. 

The steak frites were good. The fries were excellent, and fries aren't usually something I notice, so well done! The steaks themselves were great, but not the best I've had in the Cville area (I think I'm still committed to South and Central). For the price, however, this place is amazing! Bearnaise sauce was thoroughly delicious.  

Our waiter was 10/10, and perhaps one of the best servers I've had in a long time, polite, charming, and knowledgeable. When there was a problem with my fiancés first drink (a lone bug had made a dive into it), he was able to comp it for 50% (totally fair because he had drunk half of it!!), and got my fiancé the classic old fashioned (which he ordered instead, and thought tasted better anyways). 

The ambiance was relaxed, a comfortable volume to have a private conversation, and cozy. The seating was comfortable as well. Cool to be able to see and smell the grill. I also LOVED the music (a nice mix of music from the 30s-60s). 

Overall, great vibes, great flavors and great values.",141.0,Black Cow,0.9977,Friday

12,2023-04-17,4.0,Love this newly opened restaurant! I got the steak frites for the happy hour deal(highly recommend taking advantage of that) and holyy COW they were udder-ly delicious! The fries were crispy and seasoned well while the steak itself was terrifically tender. Our server was also really knowledgeable of the menu and the service was overall superb. Will definitely come back here to try more of the appetisers and the other cocktails!,38.0,Black Cow,0.981,Monday
13,2023-04-23,4.0,"Had a nice Sunday happy hour dinner here with friends. I ordered the Black Cow Steak Frites with the add-on Little Salad, and a glass of their happy hour featured red wine. The featured red wine was a Malbec. The chef's choice daily cut was a hanger steak with chimichurri sauce. I'm a simple guy--steak frites paired with a nice red and I'm happy. The salad was a nice fresh and tasty addition to the meal. One note that I have is that I preferred the hanger steak without the chimichurri sauce. I felt that the hanger steak was seasoned well already, and that the chimichurri muted some of the steak's already nicely developed flavors. The regular menu is pricy, but I enjoyed my happy hour experience here and thought it was a great deal. I guess you could say that happy hour at Black Cow was in fact happy.",372.0,Black Cow,0.9916,Sunday
14,2023-04-23,5.0,We sat outside on the patio. It was a little chilly but they had heaters on the deck. The staff was all nice. The steaks were amazing.,402.0,Black Cow,0.872,Sunday
15,2023-01-05,5.0,"5 stars. We have a group we call The Fifty Shades of Gravy Club. We go to a different restaurant the last Saturday of the month. This month we choose this place. When we called for a reservation for a party of 8, they couldn't get us seated together. However, we arrived at 4:30 and Daniel figured out where he could put two tables together as long as we promised to be done by 6:30. I said it would depend on if we got fast service, and boy did we! Our waiter was John. His second day on the job. He was a Wizard. We got happy hour drinks (can you imagine happy hour on a Saturday!) He described all the meats and told us which ones were flavorful but chewy, and which were tender. The sauces were extra. They were to die for. The meat entrees came with a salad that was lightly dressed with a homemade dressing of your choice. Most of the sides were family style and sooo good. I am doing a Keto diet so I was in heaven. The portions of the steak most of us order were huge. Two of the smart people among us shared theirs. I took my leftover home and had dinner again the next day. AND instead of handing me a box for my leftovers, John took my plate back to the kitchen and transferred my food into a styrofoam box that had parchment paper in it. Who does that anymore!?! It was great because I was able to transfer the food using the parchment paper instead of scraping it off the box. Everyone loved what they ordered. I will definitely return to this restaurant again. It is now my new favorite.",16.0,Black Cow,0.9912,Thursday
16,2023-07-05,5.0,"This place is so great!! I love wood-fired meats, generally, and they have chosen quality vendors for them. Drinks, apps, salads, mains, lobster mac and cheese (best I've ever had!!), and dessert was perfect for my husband's (chef) birthday. It's nice to see a menu that is streamlined, straightforward, and executed perfectly in a restaurant that knows itself and it's customers. 

Being a new location, you expect some hiccups, but they really have nailed it with every aspect. They fill that space well. We can't wait to go back.",49.0,Black Cow,0.9385,Wednesday

18,2023-05-29,5.0,"We were passing through Charlottesville and were looking for a good place for dinner.  We found the Black Cow and were really glad we chose this restaurant to eat at.  The service was fantastic, but the food is what we will remember most!  The smoked oysters are to die for, the truffle fries are the best we have ever had ANYWHERE, the burger was fantastic and the beet salad was amazing. This restaurant is new and I truly hope the locals support them so that we can keep coming back whenever we are in Charlottesville!",4.0,Black Cow,0.9831,Monday

You can spend a lot or spend a little (one great steak frites special), and the cocktail menu keeps you coming back for more.

20,2023-11-06,5.0,"We had a great dinner here for our anniversary! Once we were there, we learned the restaurant has only been open a few months. The steaks were cooked to perfection! Each entree comes with a side salad (which was large) of tender greens with thin sliced radish and cucumber. We had the Choice of their homemade ranch or vinaigrette, which were both tasty. We had the steak tartar for an appetizer and it was on point!! I had the filet mignon and my husband the Chateubriand  and they were both cooked to perfection. My filet was like butter. You have several choices of toppings for your steak, if you wish. My husband got the béarnaise sauce and it was very light and tasty. Each steak also comes with a yummy roasted pearl onion/garlic side. We share the creamed spinach for a side and it was delicious! The key lime pie is probably better then the key lime pie we had in the Keys! Tart and sweet but not too sweet. Our server was very nice and informative and knew the menu well and gave good recommendations- which we appreciate. We would definitely recommend this place and we will return when we visit Cville in the future.",13.0,Black Cow,0.9918,Monday
21,2023-06-13,5.0,Superb!! Service was great. Everyone was very helpful navigating the menu. The food was fantastic with the exception of the Brussel sprouts which were almost burnt in my opinion.

22,2023-06-27,5.0,Their Ny Strip is one of the best steaks I've ever had. Service was excellent and after dinner drinks at the bar were on point. Excellent high end bourbon selection as well.  Looking forward to making this my go to restaurant when visiting C'Ville.,2.0,Black Cow,0.9287,Tuesday

24,2023-05-07,5.0,"This past weekend we ate at Black Cow Chophouse and I enjoyed one of the best meals I've ever had! 

We had their special mezcal cocktail to start then ordered the buttermilk fried oysters for an appetizer. I love fried oysters but these were were absolutely fantastic. 

All of the mains come with a fresh green salad with a choice of housemade dressings.  I got the fresh greens with vinaigrette dressing and while everyone makes a vinaigrette this one was exceptionally tasty.

We shared the bone in ribeye steak and an order of crab cakes for our main meal. 

The steak was delicious on its own but we added a few sauces including bearnaise sauce, peppercorn cream with cognac sauce and the horseradish sauce all of which were wonderful and pretty much pushed the steak over the top. 

The crab cakes had huge pieces of pure lump crabmeat combined with fresh seasonings, served with a light aioli so the flavor of the crabmeat really came through. 

We also ordered sides of smashed potatoes, fried brussel sprouts and fresh grilled zucchini. The potatoes were cooked so they were soft on the inside but had a slight crunch when you bit into them. They were topped with a light chimichurri sauce that made an amazing dish even better.  I'm not a brussel sprouts fan but the fried brussel sprouts were fantastic, light and slightly crisp so they would just melt in your mouth. I couldn't stop eating them! Then, I really wasn't expecting anything from the zucchini but again I was surprised by a dish that was lightly seasoned and cooked perfectly so it really provided a great balance to the meal. For dessert we shared the key lime pie and the chocolate mousse with sea salt and again, both dishes were fantastic - the key lime pie is now my favorite dessert of all time.

The staff were extremely attentive and delivered fantastic service. Our server did a great job covering the restaurants approach to food and service and helped guide us through the menu making excellent suggestions for wines, appetizers and our dinner selection.

The ambiance is fun and engaging vs. formal and stuffy which makes the whole experience at Black Cow Chophouse even more enjoyable.",3.0,Black Cow,0.9991,Sunday
25,2023-08-07,5.0,"My husband and I had an amazing anniversary dinner here this evening. From the spectacular service to the delicious food, so, so good. I wanted to try something different and had the bavette. SO. GLAD. I. DID. I had it with the chimichurri, but honestly, it didn't need it. I found myself going to the confit garlic on the side even more than the chimichurri, which was good by the way. That garlic though, I am going to need to learn how to make that at home. The smashed red potatoes were killer. We told our waiter we just wanted potatoes as a side, and for him to choose. Solid choice he made for us!",28.0,Black Cow,0.9331,Monday
26,2023-07-13,5.0,"Tonight was a great night came in from Los Angeles to visit some family that have relocated.

Got a massive meal 5 apps, everyone got steaks,etc.

My steak was a bit undercooked while all the rest were perfect. I didn't even say anything but server could tell I wasn't pleased and rectified the situation very swiftly.

All in all we left full and the deserts were great.

Appreciate tier one level service and food on a Friday night in a small town!",51.0,Black Cow,0.9385,Thursday
27,2023-05-08,4.0,"Food was impeccable. We had a type of cut I had the Bavette, which I was excited to try and had never had before. Sides were also great. And while we sat outside and it was hot as you know what, it was manageable. The interior design is impressive and I'd return to eat inside. 

This place gets an additional star with an attitude adjustment. Pretentiuos hostess and pretentious, disinterested, gloomy server. 
I get it, everyone has a bad day. But put on your game-face for a few hours and smile at your customer.  We are an engaging fam...we are not pretentious and generally look for and bring positive mojo.  Perhaps it is just C-ville...but I doubt it.  #smile, please.",27.0,Black Cow,0.9224,Monday

Our server was so helpful and polite - and the food was absolutely amazing! We both went with a filet mignon and shared the lobster Mac n cheese- oh wow, could not have had a better choice if we had tried!

33,2023-07-09,5.0,"Really great place! Pretty interiors, busy bar, quick crowd. Friendly accommodating service. I ordered their drink special which was the pineapple fin- a really refreshing pineapple-infused finlandia vodka. Wish it was chilled a bit more but I really appreciated the big chunk of pineapple. I was worried it might be too sweet and ""juice"" tasting but I could really tell the cocktail was just infused (30 days, apparently!)

For food I started with the sherry vinaigrette salad. Simple mixed greens but the greens were super tender and fresh. Dressing was light, the added pickled onions and fine shredded parmesan were great. I got the bavette steak cooked medium, with side sauces of the peppercorn and the chimichurri. The steak had a great sear, came out more on the medium rare side and a tad salty, but the beef flavor was great. Also tried the creamed spinach and whipped potatoes which were so comforting and delicious, the potatoes were SO dangerously buttery and creamy. We also tried the belgian fries which were underwhelming- dry, felt a bit stale to me, no flavor. They are apparently featured as a specialty (double fried and all that) but reminded me of In-n-Out's anticlimactic fries. 

For dessert we tried the crême brûlée, which was SO decadent with a perfectly crisp glassy top. The key lime pie had a perfect balance of flavor, tartness, sweetness, and a creamy texture complemented well with the crunchy rich crust. I didn't get a chance to try the flourless cake and ice cream but they must have been food because they were gone in a pinch!

Overall great place, I would come back if I was in the area. Lots of options to fit any budget and generally enjoyable experience!",131.0,Black Cow,0.9983,Sunday

37,2023-10-13,4.0,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and I would say the steak at Black Cow is solid. I thought the steak was seasoned well on its own. Glad to see that they aren't afraid to use salt! We also ordered some sides to share with the table and the lobster mac and cheese was definitely the showstopper. I liked how the mac and cheese had a slight crust on it. The only thing about our experience is that some of our steaks were inconsistent in terms of cook.

Now this wasn't your Texas Roadhouse bread and butter...this was bread and butter made from God himself. On the side we got whipped mashed potatoes...like holy cow! Gloriousness. Then to finish it off we got crème brûlée and **** me that was to die for. And let me say all that was inexpensive for the heaven that reached my stomach.

What a steal for a high quality tasty steak and delicious crispy fries. I got to try the flank with chimichurri sauce and it was perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful. I have nothing bad to say about it! I also tried the fried brussels - one of my favorite sides/appetizers and they did not disappoint.

My only complaint is that the chef cooks burgers ""pink"" or ""some pink"". My fiancee thought it was perfect and melted in his mouth, but I ordered mine ""some pink"" and really struggled. It wasn't the usual ""medium"" pink I order.

47,2024-01-20,2.0,"Maybe it was just a really off night for the food we were served when we visited the Black Cow Chophouse . They have an amazing sounding happy hour where you can order Steak Frites for $18. We decided to stop in after a long week of work and got there around 5:40 (happy hour of 4-6). The hostess told us we had 5 minutes to order so we hurried to the last two seats at the bar and ordered quickly.

I ordered a Moscow Mule and my boyfriend ordered a Margarita. Both were just not good. The Moscow mule had virtually no ginger beer in it.

The steak dinners were so disappointing. Everything was SO salty-I couldn't even eat the fries. The one steak was cooked incorrectly (asked for medium rare and it was medium well). Both steaks were warm at best, definitely not fresh. We understand steaks need to rest but these had rested wayyyy too long. 

The bartender never checked on us. The two stars are for the ambiance of the restaurant. For almost $70, definitely a disappointing visit.",227.0,Black Cow,-0.1069,Saturday
48,2024-01-21,5.0,"The Black Cow Chophouse is one of the most amazing places I have ever dined. I have spent six months trying to come up with a way to accurately describe this restaurant in a review. The staff and service is phenomenal, personal, and full of expertise. The selection of local steak is not only artisan but also very well priced, the cocktails are handcrafted with a wonderful attention to detail. The Steak Tare Tare and the crushed potatoes are by far the best food I've ever had, over the several visits to the Black Cow the bar is raised every time by consistent performance. I have had the luxury of eating across several countries and I can say without a doubt the Black Cow Chophouse is one of the finest places I have ever been.

This is while someone was already preparing the table for our group. Clearly communication lacks between employees. Next time it will be nice to know from the beginning and not have us wait in the cold (outside) while they figured they didn't have enough food to serve people.

We were only in town for two days and didn't have dinner plans our second night, but we had walked past this place earlier in the day and decided to come back that night - so glad we did! It was pretty full, even at 8:45 when we got there, and the vibe was great - simple and modern aesthetic, laid back feel, friendly staff, good wine list - checked all the boxes!

We shared the bone-in KC strip and the whipped golden potatoes for dinner. The steak tasted great - we ordered in medium rare, and it almost looked closer to rare, but I'll take that over a steak being overcooked any day. I liked the confit onions & garlic and the generous pile of sea salt on the plate with the steak, too - really brought out the flavor! The whipped potatoes were a treat as well - they had some of the confit onions and garlic on them too, and they were a great compliment to the meat.

Last time I went, I was asked if I wanted my steak ""pink or no pink"" which is very strange and probably not what you should be asking for a steak. The steak came out cold and raw on the inside. Given the language on the menu, the kitchen seems to have strong opinions on how a steak needs to be cooked (raw/rare).

The venue is cool.  It appears to be an old service station that has been  decorated in a bovid motief.  It has a nice bar, not very large, seats about 10.  Outside dining is available

We did not have reservations, and the wait was about an hour, so we chose to eat at the bar.  Good choice!  The bartender (Noah) was excellent.  The bourbon selection was also excellent.  I had my first pour of Woodford 121.2.  Really enjoyed it.

The salads were good.  Warm bread was served.  We both had the New York strip, and they were nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked.

Lobster mac and cheese sauce was a little grainy, maybe too much flour used. It also had little to no seasoning. Was disappointed given the cost.

We decided to order one additional steak a few minutes before the happy hour promotion expired, and the bartender quietly told the kitchen to rush the order so that it would come out with the rest of our food, just a couple of minutes later. The happy hour steak frites special is a must-order, and an incredible value. Highly recommend if you're in Charlottesville and staying near the downtown area.

The sauce that came with it was a house made A-1 sauce that was really good and blue cheese crumbles.Fries were good, but nothing over the top. Our side was the summer squash! What the hell...! To make that vegetable stand out like it did, I was speechless.  Roasted and placed in a cashew pesto!! We were fighting with forks for the last bite!
One more drink each. Oh our hostess came over and wished us a happy anniversary, and made my wife tear up when she read to my wife what I wrote about her. Very nice young lady and I am so sorry that I forgot her name. 
 The dessert....holy moly....!
The chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce was a knockout! I would bar fight the whole

It was great to see a new steakhouse--and a good one!-- has finally opened.  A friend invited us for a very early dinner so we could try the ""early bird"" Steak and Frites meal.  At $18, it seemed too good to be true.  It isn't!  It appears they vary the steak cut and the sauce each week.  This time it was 6 oz sirloin with meunière sauce and fries.  For $3 you can add a dinner salad, which I did.  The steak was prepared perfectly: rare for me and well done for my wife (they say there are only two choices, pink and well, but I asked for the rarest they would cook my steak and was very happy).  We both passed on the sauce, which the flavorful, juicy steak didn't need.  My salad was just fine.  The highlight of the meal--good as the steak was--is the fries.  A nice portion of perfectly fried, hot, relatively thin French fries.

Our waiter was friendly, patient, and helpful.  The entire experience was excellent and we will return, and not just for the special.  The regular steak menu looked wonderful.  While not cheap, for a high-end steakhouse prices seemed quite reasonable.",36.0,Black Cow,0.9946,Saturday

My husband loved the bernaise sauce with the filet. For sides we had spinach and the Belgian fries. The spinach is definitely pretty spinachy if that makes sense. Not your typical creamed spinach. It was good. The fries were very small and crispy and not like anything we had in Belgian. The flavor was good but I would skip them next time.

We were well taken care of by the hostess and bartender who got us to the bar around 7:30 after we opened a bottle of wine on their outdoor lounge. 

The bar was cozy and the servers were attentive and warm, but the food was exactly what I needed that day! They cook their burgers ""no pink"" or ""pink"" and I assume ""no pink"" is closer to medium and ""pink"" is medium rare to rare. We ordered a bacon bleu burger ""pink"" and were really happy with it. Typically I like my burgers medium so I might try taking my chances with the no pink next time since I can't see them cooking it over with their ""no well done"" policy for the cuts of meat. 

The fries, Brussels sprouts, and Mac and cheese were delicious, especially with the garlic aioli. I think after the burger, the Mac and cheese was a favorite.

We placed our orders (party of four) and two of use do not eat salads. After some time passed we were given 2 salads and one portion of bread for 4 people. Almost one hour passed and we still didn't have our entrees. I asked for another bread and she said it would cost $3. I said it was ok and she came back and told us they will not be doing double breads. 

About 15 mins later the meals came out and my medium well steak was clearly undercooked. It was pink and a little bloody. The waitress told me that it was medium well in front of my party. I disagreed and she then agreed to recook it. Another person in my party ordered a medium steak and it was also bloody. She didn't want to say anything after seeing the reaction I got. They brought my steak back to me and half of it was cooked and the other half looked the same. She walked away before I could say anything. I actually picked up the plate, located her and told her I give up. The manager came over and told me she wanted to talk about the steak. Again, this felt weird in front of my party and I'm on the spot. I said half of it was improved but it's too bloody on the other. I just wanted to move on.

You can tell the meat here is very high quality. The steak came out with a lovely sear. The flavor was rich and meaty; my steak was very well marbled and fatty. I loved that the steaks were served with flaked finishing salt that you could sprinkle on, yourself. I believe the biggest factor was that David cooked our steaks to PERFECTION. My husband got the NY Strip and he was over the moon. I tried a bite and it was just fantastic. I'm not even a NY strip eater! You can easily mess up a Strip. And yet it was juicy and tender.

I personally don't think the steak needed a sauce.

As for the appetizers and sides, the bread was excellent and fresh. The cesar salad was very very tasty. The shrimp cocktail was great! But the real show were those steaks. John, our waiter, encouraged us as first time guests to get steak (over the pork chop I was considering), and I'm so thrilled he did. A warm and genuinely friendly waiter, John made the night. I trusted his suggestions, and very happy I did. You can tell John loves his job, and he's good at it.

The prices were fair given the quality of the ingredients.

The ambiance of the restaurant was somewhat loud but that never hindered our conversations or evening.

The final suprise of the night was the desserts. The key lime pie was literally the best key lime pie I've ever had. Was such a perfect touch to a wonderful evening.

Kudos to this team. A giant thank you to John for taking such great care of us, and the highest compliments to David and the chefs who prepared the meals.

While the drinks were food and drinks were excellent, we were hustled multiple times during the meal, before we even ordered; we were told several times that our table needed to be done by a specific time (2 hours). we were told at least 3 times that we needed to be faster, when we finished our main and inquired about desert we were told that the next table was here and that we could only have dessert to go. when the check arrived we set it for pay immediately, but they took 10 min to collect it, which felt strange considering that they had been adamant that they needed the table.
not sure if this is their policy or they poorly planed their reservations
Great food does not make up for poor treatment by staff, and 2 hours at a steak house is not a long time for a group of 4.

I ended up getting eggs with a side of bacon.  I sat down and someone yelled out my name when the order came up.  We weren't sure if we heard it correctly one time and grabbed someone else's (but went back up to confirm).  The bacon WAS good as was the eggs and bread, however, my plastic utensils broke and the cardboard box walls were so tall that it was difficult to eat and I ended up ripping the top off.  It seemed like such a huge waste of paper and the trash can was overflowing with big boxes.  I really hope they're working out the kinks and that they do have a legitimate brunch one day.  It was a great spot!  The coffee is also meh.  I heard another patron mention it as well and they just dumped it out.

The English muffin was homemade which I totally applaud but in this instance it was too big and a bit doughy. However the next time I went I ordered a blueberry muffin and it came fresh from the oven and perfectly cooked!

I then had the avocado toast with sunny egg and it was on point. They use their homemade bread for the toast and it's so so good with a thick crunchy crust. He had the avocado, chili paste and egg sandwich on brioche and it looked amazing. The kids shared a #2 - bacon egg and cheese on an English muffin, which was homemade and extra delicious.

The English muffins were fresh baked, soft, and delicious. The bacon and egg were cooked well, and the cheddar was nice and melted how I like it. 

The Belle Benedict with Lox was great. The bread was freshly baked and paired nicely with the runny egg to soak up the yolk. And the microgreen salad complimented the dish well to give it more freshness.

The combination of the sweetness of the jam (I believe it was apricot?) and the saltiness of the prosciutto created an amazing flavor profile. I added an egg, but I would recommend to just get the sandwich as is. The egg made it a little too messy and didn't add much flavor-wise. However, all the original components of the sandwich were delicious, and to top it all off it was served on a homemade english muffin! I also tried the avocado toast.

156,2021-11-30,5.0,"As an unabashed lover of carbs and a gluten enthusiast, Belle's menu based on naturally leavened breads enthused me. My wife and I finally checked out this place during a recent Friday lunch, and our meal left us thoroughly impressed. 

We opted for Belle's take on an Italian hoagie for me and a eggplant-tahini sandwich for her. As a Philadelphian, I take my hoagies very seriously and have had many a disappointing sub during my time in the South. Belle's rendition tasted so good I nearly wept. The bread makes the sandwich, and Belle's hoagie roll could go toe-to-toe with the best rendition I've had in Philly and elsewhere. The quality Italian cold cuts, zippy pepper relish, and crisp lettuce and tomato made for a bite that reminded me of home and satisfied immensely. 

While I'm partial to the hoagie for sentimental reasons, my wife's eggplant sandwich tasted equally good. Hers arrived on crispy yet fluffy focaccia paired smartly with meaty eggplant, chopped eggs, and creamy potato chunks tossed in a deliciously verdant tahini sauce. The sandwich was incredibly messy but offered a punch of flavor on, of course, awesome bread. We ended with a sweet treat in Belle's sourdough cinnamon roll. The roll itself was not too sweet and the sour kick from the ferment played well with the sugary glaze. The base bread was moist and chewy, and thus represented a big improvement from most of the cinnamon rolls we tried prior.

The carb feast sat well in our stomachs, a testament to the slow, natural fermentation this place specializes in.

When the sandwich that I ordered came out, it was cold and the avocado it had on it tasted rotten (you know that unfortunate taste avocado has when it's just not right...). It also just had what tasted like a cold Sriracha chili sauce squirted all over it. 

I went up to the lady working the register and showed her my sandwich and explained that the avocado tasted rotten and would it be possible to get something different? She got a man from the kitchen who I assume was the manager and I repeated the predicament to him to which he just stared at me and replied blankly ""Well that's too bad,"" with no sense of sympathy, apology, or customer service. 

IMO, this is very poor management of a restaurant and I will not be going back and will not be recommending this place. There are too many cafés and bakeries in town to waste another brunch here.",29.0,Belle,-0.926,Sunday

I had a warm coffee along with the #1 which is the egg, sausage and cheese sandwich on a brioche bun. It was huge and I think I'd use a fork next time since it was falling all over the place but decadent. Definitely get your $$ worth!! The sausage patty was enormous and jam packed with seasoning, the egg was fluffy but I would have preferred a choice of cheese since I'm not a yellow cheese fan (you wouldn't be either if you ever visited Cabot Creamery in Vermont!).

If you want to have a nasty message written about you to describe what table to deliver your food, this place is for you. Despite the very nice aesthetic, good food, and outdoor seating, the front staff is incredibly unprofessional and rude. Despite their demeanor, our group chocked it up to being very busy, which was understandable. We placed our order and found a table outdoors. However, when our food was delivered to our table, our receipt described one person in our group as ""the little bitc* in the red crop top and purple shorts"" as the person to deliver the food to. Amazingly, the server set this receipt down directly in front of us in full view. We were shocked, as there was not any sort of confrontation or atypical interaction with the woman taking our order. Upon talking about this with the employee who wrote the message, she simply said ""okay"" and walked away. For a business with a photo of ""Rosie the Riveter"" on the wall, they surely do not know how to respect other women.

No problem. The hostess/waitress comes around to take our drink order and we hang out.  30 minutes later we are seated but still haven't received our drinks.  And we're seated at a table for 8 even though our reservation is for 10 people.  Two people in our group are late so we've ordered appetizers and they order drinks and appetizers.  All our appetizers come and our drinks finally arrive 45 min after we got there  minus our friends who are late drinks.  

We put in our dinner orders and another round of drinks.  Our friends still haven't received their first drinks.  

Our dinners come and our friends still don't have their drinks.  The bartender has no clue. An hour after our friends ordered their drinks they finally get their drinks AFTER THEY ASKED where they were.   It was clear their drink order hadn't been put in or the bartender didn't see it.  

I really enjoyed our Brussel sprouts appetizer and sourdough bread appetizer.  We got the steak frites and it was fine. Nothing to write home about.  Half our party got the butternut squash risotto and there was zero butternut squash in it and the truffle was overwhelming.  Our entire table smelled like truffle oil.  

It took forever to get drink orders. Even though it's a small restaurant it was clear that the bartender could not keep up with the service. They probably need a second bartender.

I'm from PA, where pizza shops are abundant and subs with fresh baked bread are top notch. Italian subs are one of my absolute favorite delights.

Now, when I say the Italian sandwich at Belle is stellar, I cannot under emphasize the authenticity of this classic. It's an iconic replication of the standard with class, tact and intention. The sourdough roll/mini baguette is out of this world soft with a nice toasty crust. 

It seems like the meat is sourced ethically, but maybe I'm making that up for the sake of my own pretentious nature. Then, the hunk of real mozzarella is a delicious touch of mouth watering fat. Top it with the thin sliced reds and a balanced mix of Mayo / oil / vin and pepper relish?! AYFKM?! 

Pair it with a Mexican Coke and you have an ""elevated staple"". There I go with the pretentiousness again 

I want to also acknowledge the incredible staff who made accommodations for us driving a long distance and running really close to closing time.

Came last night just for drinks because a friend and I just had dinner. Bang! Has such an extensive cocktail/mixed drink selection. I saw prickly pear mojito and decide why not.this of course was after careful debate and endless consulting with our bartender. She told me it was sweeter then a typical mojito...well I've had horrible mojitos if it's sweeter maybe it won't taste crappy like the other ones I've had else where. Yay! Our bartender was the bomb...she made a mojito that didn't over muddle my mint and it tasted awesome love the prickly pear :o)  my friend got her usual the sin city and I stole a sip it was a sweet martini almost juice like not bad though pretty smooth. 

Of course I wanted dessert..... so why not have a dessert martini. So I got the dreamsicle....the menu said it would take me back to my childhood. Hmmm...very vanilla...where's the orange?? They did use real orange juice so perhaps that's why the flavor was there but was overshadowed by vanilla. My friend likes it and she dislikes dreamsicles a something about artificial orange that bothers her. But since this was more vanilla she didn't mind it too much.

Kale tortellini (4) - A ricotta, cheese, and kale mixture wrapped in a wonton wrapper. Very tasty, but didn't care much for the wonton wrapper -- tasted kind of slimy

Pork spring rolls (6) - spring rolls wrapped in a rice paper I think? and fried so the outside was crispy and bubbly.  I thought this was very unique and haven't seen anything like it before! Perfectly seasoned, which is rare for spring rolls sometimes.  Didn't care much for the sauce it came with.  

Chicken cilantro wraps - These were pretty savory and a good balance of salty and slightly sweet, with a lot of sweet onions and peppers. I think it was all white meat, but would've probably been more flavorful with dark meat.  A full wedge of iceberg lettuce came on the side, which was very fresh and crisp.  I actually liked it more than the butter lettuce that I've usually had lettuce wraps with/

Coconut rice - Slightly sticky, sweet, and creamy, and good to pair with the other dishes.  However, we got a double portion and it was SO tiny! Like smaller than a side of rice you would get from a Chinese restaurant...yet this portion was $6...

60 second steak (6) - Very meaty and smoky, but not for everyone if you don't like your meat raw/very rare. The mushrooms it came with were meaty and flavorful too and helped amp up the small portion.  The cilantro sauce it came with too was refreshing and herbacious, but very, very light and hard to taste unless you drenched the meat in the sauce.  Two very disappointing things about this dish though: the plate was cold and I would've preferred this dish served room temp or warm.  Also the portion was TINY.  We each got literally two bites fo steak and it was $11.

Brie nachos (4) - The brie had a surprisingly meaty flavor which I enjoyed, but kind of a predictable dish overall.  Unfortunately, like the steak, this dish came out cold-- by that point the previously melted brie had solidified and was not melty anymore.  I would have preferred this dish if it came out warm so that the brie was still melty.

Goat cheese dumplings (4) - I was most excited for this one and most disappointed :( These were basically like pierogis except the filling was strangely sour (not like in a tangy goat cheese kind of way).  Portion was big though.

Drinks - Everyone was most pleased with their drinks.  We tried Sin City, Lemon Drop, Lychee, Diva, Prickly Pear -- all were good options.

Service was very friendly (although kind of annoyed that our waitress kept on pushing and pushing us to buy drinks) and pretty fast too.  Overall food was fine, but I probably won't return because the portions were so small and execution was very mediocre.",219.0,Bang,0.9958,Tuesday
221,2017-05-18,4.0,"Wow, this place is amazing! The food is so unique and absolutely wonderful. The drink list is extensive and were so yummy! My date and I had the spicy shrimp and goat cheese stuffed dumplings and they were great! Especially the dumpling. I wanted to try everything on the menu though because it all looked so good. We also tried many different drinks. I had the key lime martini, caramel apple and the espresso martini and wow wow wow. All so amazing! My date had the Mr.Big, Sin City, and Captain and enjoyed them all as well. The only con I can think of was that they were extremely low on staff but the staff that was working were doing an amazing and attentive job. 
This may be my new favorite place in Charlottesville.",22.0,Bang,0.9858,Thursday
222,2018-01-26,5.0,"Finally, a great vegetarian tapas restaurant! I came here for my birthday   and was wowwed by the uniqueness and quality of food. I ordered 6 dishes and recommend the sweet potato gnocchi, goat cheese dumplings, shredded brussel sprouts salad, and cauliflower dumplings. I wasn't a big fan of the kale ravioli or the chickpea spring rolls. 

My favorite was hands down the sweet potato gnocchi (I'm craving it just thinking about it!) I'm not a fan of gnocchi as it's often hard or too mushy, but the gnocchi was the best I've ever had. The gnocchi was so soft that it literally melted in my mouth. I love the savory sweet potato curry sauce. 

I really enjoyed the goat cheese dumplings, they are bursting with flavor and a generous portion size. 

I devoured the shredded brussel sprouts salad. Seems like a simplex dish, but has complex flavors. 

The cauliflower dumplings were perfectly fried with a nice crispy coating. I  like how they weren't doused in sauce. 

I didn't quite care for the kale ravioli. Sounds like an interesting cool concept, but very bland. The ravioli was stuffed with a kale paste, I couldn't taste any cheese or any other flavors. 

The chickpea spring rolls was another miss. It had a nice curry filling, but I didn't understand why the chick peas were served a side instead of in the roll. I'm not a fan of fried chickpeas, I like them in their natural state. 

The tapas portion sizes are quite large and filling, about 2-3 plates per person. Since I ordered 6, I brought home leftovers. As there are several options for vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free, and meat lovers, Bang! is a crowd pleaser. 

Overall, I had a hearty meal that put me in a delightful food coma. It's definitely worth the trip from DC.",1315.0,Bang,0.9978,Friday
223,2018-07-19,5.0,"What an experience! I am BLOWN AWAY by the food at this restaurant! I came for restaurant week and shared a total of 9 tapas with my friends. Every single dish was delicious and filled with rich, mouthwatering flavors! I did not think I would enjoy this restaurant this much but it is honestly so good. Our favorites were the pork steam buns, haricot vert fries (green bean fries), the goat cheese dumplings, and Korean beef empanada.

BUT the best and most life changing item was their PISTACHIO BLONDIE with coffee ice cream! It was so good that we had to order another one. The texture was so soft and smooth and the tastes all blended perfectly. Bang makes the ice cream and caramel sauce themselves and you can tell how much quality they put into this dessert. The waitress said that it's the staff favorite but customers always get the Asian doughnuts.... I'm telling you now do NOT sleep on the pistachio blondie!",19.0,Bang,0.9924,Thursday
224,2018-10-19,5.0,"This is one of my favorite, more expensive restaurants to eat at in cville. The first time I've been the service was awful, but since then, I've had superb service every time. Our waitress even took off your drinks from the tab because we had to wait so long! There's a great Asian fusion tapas menu with food that would be suitable for anyone. If you like goat cheese, the goat cheese dumplings are a must and the firecracker shrimp are always a crowd pleaser. I'd recommend around 2 tapas per person. However, the best thing on the menu in my opinion is the Sin City cocktail - it's a blackberry martini with just the right amount of tang and sweetness and no alcohol taste.",303.0,Bang,0.9798,Friday
225,2018-10-11,5.0,"This place exceeded my expectations and I'm so happy with my dining experience. I always have reservations about tapas restaurants because the plates are not filling but this place got rid of all those reservations. The only con is the price- you have to go all out or not go at all. Plan to spend at least $100 with tax and tip for two people. If you don't ball out, you probably will not have a great experience.

Here are some of the items we tried:
-Sin City Martini: This blackberry and pomegranate mix is awesome. You can't really taste the alcohol but the drink is strong. It's tangy yet sweet. Definitely recommend this martini!
-Goat Cheese Dumplings: Calling all cheese lovers. These dumplings will blow you away. They're so incredibly cheesy and crispy.
-Sweet Potato Gnocchi: Gnocchi on a whole new level. The texture is chewy yet tender. The sweetness of the sweet potatoes adds a nice flavor element.
-Crab Pot Stickers: The ginger cream ties together this dish so well. The crab was soft and savory while the wrapper was delightfully crunchy. The shiitake mushrooms topping was amazing.
-House Smoked Salmon: I don't usually like smoked salmon but it's done so well here. The salmon had a smokey flavor that's indescribable.
-Sixty Second 7 Hills Sirloin: MY FAVE. The steak was so tender and well seasoned. It was slightly charred and topped with chimichurri sauce. The fingerling potatoes were the perfect side.
-Firecracker shrimp: This dish was good, although, very basic. It's just fried tempura shrimp with a spicy mayo sauce on top. Definitely something I could make at home. In my opinion, it shouldn't be one of the most expensive item on the menu.
-Pork Belly Bun: Fatty pork belly on steamed bun? Yes, please.
-Lamb Ravioli: The ravioli was really good- filled with a lot of lamb. The sauce was insanely delicious. It had a curry flavor which gave it a nice kick.

Overall, this place is worth checking out. If you're on a budget, avoid this place because the experience will not be there. We definitely had a bang! of a time.",222.0,Bang,0.9985,Thursday
226,2019-01-23,4.0,"Decided to come here for restaurant week and was not disappointed! The key lime pie martini was amazing; the graham cracker crumbs on the rim provided the perfect touch. Tapas were delicious- 3 tapas will make you very full. The goat cheese dumplings are the best- creamy on the inside but with chewy, crispy wraps. The tuna wasabi flatbread was pretty good, too. The dressing had the perfect amount of wasabi in it, but the pita flatbread could be warmer. The duck potstickers were fantastic- highly recommend that and the goat cheese dumplings. For dessert, we got the pistachio blonde with caramel ice cream. The first few bites were heavenly but it was too rich for me to be able to enjoy the entire dish. 

Service was not bad for how busy restaurant week is. It took a while for the host to seat us, but the bartender was very nice and attentive. Overall, I'm glad I decided to give this place a try!",510.0,Bang,0.9958,Wednesday
227,2019-10-03,4.0,"I really enjoyed our experience here. I would recommend going here with a big group so that you can share everything. The dishes come out as they are made so it may be a little uncomfortable if you aren't sharing. Our group ordered upwords of 12 dishes so we had a great spread.

The Great:
Brussel Sprouts- I could have eaten the whole thing by myself. The sauce coated the whole sprout and we liked the combination of sauces.
Mahi- my personal favorite. Cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. It is a small portion so if you are wanting more than a bite I wouldn't split it between more than 2 people.
Kale Ceasar- nice texture and flavor
BBQ Tacos- mmm. Very tasty and the meat had a nice BBQ sauce
Goat Cheese Dumplings- filled up with a good amount of cheese and they mixed spice in there that made the cheese pop

The Good:
Beef Empanadas- good amount of filling inside it
Firecracker Shrimp- I don't like shrimp so I can't comment but the group liked it. Spicy!!
Chicken Shwarma- cooked really well

The Wouldn't Order Again:
Duck Pot Stickers- were okay, couldn't taste much flavor, only thing that wasn't cooked that well. A few were burned.
Chickpea Spring Rolls- everyone in our group said this was our least favorite dish. We didn't really get any flavor. It was basically mashed up chickpeas without seasoning fried
Drunken Noodles- I would just rather go get some at a Thai place that specializes in that. Others liked it.

The martinis are delicious. I always love a good key lime pie martini. It was pie in a glass! Overall, I love going here with friends and a variety of food.",396.0,Bang,0.9967,Thursday

My favorites were the pan seared mahi and the firecracker shrimp. the mahi was cooked to perfection--very moist and flavorful. The shrimp was just a great combo of various sauces. My friends were not a big fan of the Mongolian beef noodles, but I enjoyed them! 

They have some outdoor seating, but I highly recommend making a reservation because they were all reserved when we got there around 6, with an hour or so wait for availability.

The atmosphere inside is nothing to rave about, but outside seating looked like a good vibe.

Small plates, Asian fusion, lots of vegetarian options. 2-3 dishes per person is enough and I would suggest going in a bigger group to try more plates, although it's a great date spot as well. They don't take reservations for less than 6 people. The cocktail menu is extensive and on point- the Rosie and da bomb basil are my go tos if you're into gin. Goat cheese dumplings are a MUST.  I always go back to the drunken noodles and kale ceasar, but you honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I've never had less than stellar service.

-All three of their buns which counted as one tapas: pork belly, shrimp, and king oyster mushroom
-Short rib ravioli
-Lamb dumplings
-Viet pork shoulder
-Drunken eggplant noodles
-Tuna/mango poke bowl

All of it was solid. Definitely got that asian fusion vibe. Honestly my favorite was the king oyster mushroom steamed bun. The bun itself is soft and has got a nice texture that goes well with any of the fillings. But the oyster mushroom was absolutely delicious (if you like mushrooms) and was paired perfectly with their miso mayo sauce. Other things I really liked were the coconut rice in the poke bowl, and the pork shoulder. We left feeling very full! Food came out fast too.

237,2019-04-09,3.0,"It's hard to pinpoint the type of cuisine found at Bang!... there are definitely Asian flavors in there, but they're fusion-ed up with some touches of - dare-I-say - French cuisine and latin flair!  

Came on a Wednesday and was so pleasantly surprised to find out that it was Specials Night!  $6 Tapas and $7 Martinis - what a steal!  We ordered a nice variety - the korean empanadas, the shrimp shumai, the beef noodles, the kale cesar, and the Thai meatballs.  My favorites were definitely the beef noodles and the kale cesar salad, with the meatballs coming in close.  Flavors were fun and interesting!  My one piece of beef (pun slightly intended) with the dishes is that they were a little on the oily/saucy side.  This might just be me, but even though I loved the noodles, I felt like they were dripping with oil.  The salad was bomb, but had a little too much dressing on it for my taste.  The shumai - which are not reaaallly shumai - were slippery and hard to hold their shape.

Please, do not get me wrong - I will most likely be coming back to Bang!  the flavors were on point and unique!  Nonetheless this was my takeaway from my experience.  Also, the service was absolutely incredible!  Our server was attentive and very kind, and continuously making sure that we were well taken care of.

They have amazing drinks, probably the best Martinis in town.
There really isn't an option to order a full meal, the whole concept is that you get multiple small plates that you share with others. So if you're not a share you may not want to go with other people.
All of the small plates are quite delicious and paired well with complementary flavors. I've been here at least twice, and I've not been disappointed by any of the plates or drinks I've gotten. Giving us such a small location, if there are big parties of people it can get pretty loud, which makes it difficult to have a nice intimate dinner.",73.0,Bang,0.9807,Wednesday

The buns were a little more disappointing. They were small, even for bao. The real problem was that the chicken was clearly not fresh. It was chewy and tough like it had sat out for a while, and was room temp. The beef was better tasting but also not warm. 

The drink was very strong and had good flavor. It looked smaller in the cup it comes in, but was just right for two cups.

Would order again: genera tso's cauliflower, fried brussels, Kale Caesar

Enjoyed but didn't love: goat cheese dumplings, fried chicken buns, pork belly buns, edamame

Would pass: drunken noodles

The vegetarian items were the star of the show. As with most other tapas, I found Bang to be slightly overpriced for what you get.

Upon entering the area we were greeted with a sign at the front which explained dining instructions, takeout instructions, as well as opening hours! (Pictured)

We of course opted to sit outside on their front porch to look at all the beautiful plants and spring scenery! We were seated, and greeted by a sweet server who told us about the menu and how to work it!

I came into this knowing we would order several small plates to share so here we go!

Caesar Kale Salad- this was very crunchy, fresh, and cool on a warmer day! It was beautifully plated and seasoned nicely. It was a little on the sweeter side for my liking but I enjoyed it anyways! (Love a good starter salad)

Drunken Noodles- These also had a wonderful flavor and were mixed with yummy veggies and mushrooms and a hint of spice amidst the sweet sauce!

House Pickles- I love pickles! Almost everywhere I go if it's on the menu, I'll try them! These are the sweeter type, not dill, tad bit of a spice, and very crunchy and delicious!

Chicken Buns- These are the BEST!!! The buns were so soft and doughy and the chicken was deliciously moist with a wonderful spicy Mayo! I could have eaten about three of those in addition to the other things we ordered! What can I say? I love chicken and this his all the spots for me!!!

Braised Short-Rib Dumplings- These were to die for and they certainly didn't hold back on the meat for all you meat lovers! They were literally packed with the tenderest rib meat with just the right spices! The miso mayo was a favorite and complimented the dish very well!

Crab Pot Stickers- Came out beautiful as did the rest! The post sticker had a nice crispy shell that wasn't greasy at all. The filling was a nice blended filling with a delicates crab and seafood taste (according to my husband, I'm not the seafood lover). They looked awesome and as was everything, BEAUTIFUL!

Water was brought out complimentary and we ordered two sprites which were served in cans with glasses of ice.

She mentioned there were a lot of daily specials online but couldn't remember what they were because there were so many. We got the impression that the restaurant preferred us to order online rather than engaging the waitress. 20 minutes later the waitress dropped by to ask if we were ready to order something. Which we had already, 20 minutes ago via the QR code.

*Pork BBQ Taco: A fun crispy shell and a generous heaping of savory shredded pork. I am not usually a bbq taco fan, but I liked this one because it wasn't an overpowering bbq flavor

*Short Rib Dumplings: These were excellent!! Savory, good amount of meat, dumpling wasn't overly thick

*Korean Beef Empanada: Pretty good. the Meat wasn't evenly distributed but still flavorful

*General Tsos Cauliflower: I don't know why but I wasn't expecting breaded and fried, but it was and the flavor profile was spot on

*Crab pot stickers: Probably my least favorite. The crab flavor is just over powering so it was a little one note

*Goat cheese dumplings: YUM. lightly fried goat cheese works.

*Tuna poke bowl: Really good. Would be better if the tuna was raw, it didn't need to be seared

We ordered the Brussels, Ginger Pear & Avocado Salad, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, and Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs. The Brussels were delicious but I felt like the other dishes were average.

The Flash Fried Brussels tasted amazing. They were perfectly fried, and the sauce and seasoning on the Brussel sprouts were tasty. I would definitely order this dish again.

The Ginger Pear & Avocado Salad had a great flavor profile. The sweet pear, salad greens, and dressing were really nice; however, the dish would have been perfect if the avocado were fresher (dark spots can be seen in the picture). For a restaurant like Bang!, I would expect the ingredients to be fresher and held to a higher standard. Especially the vegetables considering it leans more vegetarian in its options.

The Pork Belly Steamed Buns were good but not amazing. We enjoyed the dish; however, coming from DC, I've tasted better and more delectable pork belly buns.

The Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs were average. There are definitely better ribs in Charlottesville for much less. That's not to say that the ribs tasted bad because they tasted good, but for the price they did not meet my expectations.

Overall, Bang! is a a good spot for date night. The restaurant and outdoor seating is cute and perfect for a nice summer day. I would highly recommend the Flash Fried Brussels if you find yourself here.",372.0,Bang,0.9986,Wednesday
263,2021-10-07,4.0,"I had come here once before and came back with my boyfriend because of my raving review the first time. Unfortunately, the food didn't measure up this time around, although the goat cheese dumplings were truly a delight (and likely the most popular item). 

Before ordering, we were told that the tapas (as the name suggests) are fairly small, except for the drunken noodles and the tuna poke bowl, so we should order 2-3 per person. We opted to order 6 in total (ended up being 5 because one of the items ordered was forgotten by the restaurant, and we chose to cancel it). Wow was that a mistake. The portions for many of the ones we ordered were huge! All except maybe the goat cheese dumplings, which we absolutely liked the most.

We ordered:
1. Sweet potato gnocchi
2. Goat cheese dumplings
3. Fried brussel sprouts
4. Kale caesar
5. Tuna poke bowl
(We cancelled the thai carrot and mango salad.) 

The best: goat cheese dumplings, followed by the sweet potato gnocchi. So rich and yummy.

If you're a drinker, the whiskey sour is a MUST to order. It may be the best whiskey sour I ever had. My boyfriend got it, and I immediately regretted my rosé wine choice. They can definitely be dangerous if you get more than 1!

The rest: nothing to write home about. The brussel sprouts were drenched in the cream. I tried to pour some of it out onto another plate, and it was just leaking sauce. My boyfriend liked the kale caesar, but it was nothing special to me. The tuna poke bowl? Seared tuna--not what you'd expect for poke IMO. 

We weren't in any rush, but be prepared to wait a little bit for your food, as they appeared to be understaffed but very busy. We thought we would have to wait for a table outside at first, given a sign indicating a 30-min wait when we arrived. However, there was plenty of outdoor seating in the back. We sat at a huge picnic table--just the two of us. The downside? The picnic table was crawling with little ants, so we had to use a spare paper menu to get rid of them throughout the meal.

The duck steamed buns and sweet potato gnocchi were my personal favorites. The sauce on the gnocchi has the perfect balance of savory and sweet, and the gnocchi itself was super tender and flavorful. The duck paired amazingly with the pickled red onions, resulting in a perfect bite! My dates favorite dish was the goat cheese dumplings, which were also heavenly.

She said go to the southern across the street for a drink, we did and after our drinks were served 5 minutes later - she texted and said our table was ready. Really? This is not brain surgery.

The service gets worse. The older mature man who attended to us ""the waiter"" never even gave us his name and treated us like we were in a car in line at McDonald's. His lack of support and attention to detail really made the 1st time experience at Bang - average.  He was not interested, didn't listen and had no enthusiasm for the waitlisted culinary experience. When we asked him what suggestions, he rattled off the three most expensive items. Really?

To the chef: of the 12 items we ordered the kale tortellini, pork taco, chicken bun were the best. Your food rocks. Maybe consider opening a food truck and be done with the noise of an average restaurant. You're better that this.

277,2022-01-16,5.0,"Bang! Leaves me practically speechless every time I go. The food is consistently amazing even when toying with the different menu options. 

The way Bang! operates is not a usual dining experience you may be used to. When your dish or your neighbors dish is ready, it comes to the table. There is no waiting to eat until everyone has their plate. This also encourages folks to get beyond just one dish since they are indeed small plates. It is a fun style. 

To start the meal, I had the curried hummus with sourdough naan. Unfortunately, I did not capture a picture of this. That speaks to the quality of the dish. Every bite was scrumptious from the warm naan to the hummus with a kick. It is a great starter and shareable between two folks I would estimate. 

For my ""main course"" I ordered the Korean Beef Empanada and Chicken Bun. Both of these were excellent. My personal favorite is the empanada which I will order every time regardless of what else I get. The beef quite literally melts in your mouth. The chicken bun is also very good and should not be overlooked! For $4 it is perfectly fine to get a handful of these as your whole meal. 

My friend also let me sample his tempura sweet potato. From my small portion, I was a fan. It was fried well but not to the point where you lose out on the sweet potato. 

For dessert I got the coconut chocolate mousse. Oh boy I'm glad I did. While it was slightly difficult to break apart with the Graham cracker crust/base, each bite was divine. It was essentially coconut chocolate mousse on top of a baked Graham cracker crust. So good! 

My friends also let me try the miso doughtnuts. These were good but my clear front runner is the coconut mouse . 

Finally, in terms of drinks, I had the Sin City and Esoresso Martini. Both of these were good but I really enjoyed the espresso. It tasted like a sweet coffee drink from a coffee shop and really does well to mask the alcohol in it.

The ambiance is so blah. Are there no interior design students to come in on the cheap and through some decor around? Because of the barren space, It isnt nice enough for a date spot.

Here are the plant based items I ordered, from best to worst:

Black Pepper Tofu. I was afraid to order this worrying f that there would be too push black pepper but it wasn't. The sauce was medium spice and the black pepper flavor was mild. You get a great amount of tofu and broccoli. This really could be an entree if you added a side of rice. This dish is why I boosted to 4 stars.

Drunken Noodles. delicious sauce and tender noodles made this one of the best drunken Noodles dish I've ordered. Other places sometimes use a boring brown sauce but Bang uses a slightly more complex sauce. 

Mushroom Bao Bun. I thought all bao buns were the same until i tried this one. This was much more dense than the airy buns I've eaten at other places. The mushrooms were shitake and had an excellent flavor that was let down by the uninspired slaw on top.

Flash Fried Brussels. Don't get the mayo bc this isnt lightly fried - its deep fried so very greasy and the mayo adds no flavor. If you ask for it vegan you'll get a different sauce.

-general tso's cauliflower: nice crunch and fried beautifully. I appreciated how hot the cauliflower were, it seemed like they were taken out right after they got fried and the sauce was very tasty 

- curried potato and cauliflower dumplings: reminds me of samosas; good seasoning in the filling and crunch

- black pepper tofu and broccoli: I really enjoyed the sauce that the plate came with; however, felt like the tofu could has been more crispy as it felt a bit soggy 

-mushroom steamed bun: honestly i was looking forward to these buns but they didn't give me as much flavor as i would have liked. The presentation of the buns is appealing though.

This place is so great for sharing! The four of us ordered:

I got the Not Your Mothers Mule, a mango mule with habanero syrup. The mango goes great with the kick. I'd say it's about a 6/10 on the heat scale. Not crazy spicy, but has a good kick. I'm not a very spicy person so if I could drink this so can you!

My boyfriend got the Calm Before (The Storm) - old fashioned with earl grey and walnut bitters. I loved the earl grey flavor! But it is a bit on the sweeter side for an old fashioned.

The food is tapas style, so we got a lot of food and we're completely stuffed by the end of the night. And I have no regrets other than I didn't have any room to get any cold Sake. Sad.

My favorites were the Shrimp Dumplings and Kale Tortellini. The tortellini were delicious! It was like a drunken noodle tortellini and the sambal brown butter sauce was the perfect pairing and gives it a tiny kick. The shrimp dumplings were a fried crispy dumpling, and I felt like it closer resembled to a taco/empanada than dumpling but they were AMAZING! I wanted to eat like 20 more. The spicy garlic mayo with the dark brown sweet drizzle was so good, even the cabbage slaw on the side was bomb! Definitely try these dumplings, they're to die for!

Started off with a banger: Korean beef empanada with a miso Mayo on the side. Delicious! Enough said 

I forgot what this was but it was chill noodles, maybe the chilled Kung Pao veggie noodles. Refreshing and I was scarfing the down. Nice umami kick to a light tasting dish

Red pepper and feta rangoons were good! The cilantro sauce was a little too thin, otherwise very good 

Ginger pork dumplings in chili oil was great but slippery with chop sticks lol. Too spicy for my fiancée but perfectly spiced for me. 

The most anticipated dish for us was the flash fried Brussels with miso Mayo and sweet soy. It def tasted good, but maybe it was speedily made because it wasn't crisp, but instead it was soggy on the outside. Had it better the first time. 

Ginger crême brûlée IS THE BOMB FINISHER. Top 3 crême brûlée for me. 

Bottom line: None of these dishes came out in any particular order, so it was a nice surprise whenever each one came out. What makes this place special is that you can share your plates with those you sit with, so our table of 2 had 6 dishes to try out and it was the perfect number.

Thinking it opened at 5p, I felt like I was stalking this place until it's actual 530p opening. The outdoor dining in the back was fitting of the menu with bamboo all around. I settled on two dishes- cauliflower and beets. My husband, over a thousand miles away, virtually rolled his eyes when I told him what I'd ordered. Well, he missed out. The cauliflower was incredible! Full of flavor, crisp, and a delicious dip that I could have sipped on its own, this is a must...even if you aren't a huge cauliflower fan, you will love this!

The food made me and my girlfriend nauseous after eating it. I still have a stomache ache and residual headache the next day. Basically made me feel as bad as a hangover without a drop of alcohol. I should have listened to the other yelp review that complained about Bang! putting greasy mayo on already greasy food. Perhaps we would have enjoyed it more if we ordered the salad, but hardly seems like our fault when over 2/3 of the menu was deep fried. The curried chickpea spring rolls were the only redeeming dish. I got the beef bbq enpanadas but didn't think it was as good as the yelp reviews made it out to be. The tempura sweet potatoes and firecracker cauliflower really pushed us over the edge. I couldn't eat another bite of grease.

First of all I love Bang for the unique concept - Asian small plates. I loveee Asian food and trying lots of items so this was perfect for me. The ambiance is also quite nice, although at first we were seated at a table right next to the door where we basically shivered every time the door opened; we then asked to move to a table upstairs and got a much more intimate spot even though there was a short wait. 

I also LOVE that almost all dishes are vegetarian / vegan or gluten-free. I was able to try so much of the menu which I'm never able to do! I'll list some of the hits and some of the misses:

Hits: Goat Cheese Dumplings (eat these hot - I hate cilantro and still was fine with the cilantro sauce they come with), Fried Rice Balls (chewy, hearty, satisfying), Kale Tortellini, Brussels Sprouts 

Misses: Eggplant Noodles (hard to eat, not chewy as expected), Avocado Wontons (avocado fell out during frying apparently because ours were basically empty), Roasted Beets (pretty good but nothing mind-blowing)

We sat outside and it was so pretty. Staff was friendly. Pretty expensive, but I knew it would be. I will definitely come back again!!

Pros- easy for your group to order multiple different plates and share. Great drinks. Vegan, vegetarian, and Gluten free options. Everyone can find something they like. 

Cons- because of the different dishes, my friends got their food way before me. My friend was done with her food before mine came. Didn't know how to properly order b/c we weren't explained the process (now I know to circle which items I want-- not a big problem at all).

***LOCATION***
This restaurant is only a couple blocks away from the Charlottesville's Historic Downtown Mall. There is a parking lot in front of it that you have to pay for. However, if you come on a Sunday or after 6pm, it's free to park there.

***EXPERIENCE***
We were a group of four. The friends I went with love this place and were excited to order for us. It's an Asian fusion tapas place. The service is a bit strange here because they grab your menu (you mark what you want and how many dishes of it) and then they disappear. It felt like they were throwing the dishes on our table and running away. At one point, they threw a dish we didn't order and before we could say something, they were already gone. I had to flag down a waiter to let them know the dish must've been for someone else. Ignoring that, we had a great time. We ordered:

Tempura sweet potatoes with hot honey feta:
This was probably my favorite dish we ordered. It wasn't covered in any sauce and the hot honey feta really complimented the fried sweet potatoes.

Goat cheese dumplings with cilantro sauce:
A lot of reviews raved about this and I understand why. We ordered two of these (they come with four dumplings), but we were stuffed by the time they came out at the end. These were one of the best things we ordered. I loved the curry flavors of the cilantro sauce. It really complimented the goat cheese. The dumplings themselves were crunchy which was really nice.

Flash fried brussels with miso mayo and sweet soy:
The brussels sprouts still had a bit of a crunch which was nice, however this dish felt like it was drowning in the miso mayo.

Ahi tuna poke tacos, pineapple, edamame:
Felt a bit drowned in the mayo sauce. The crunch of the taco shell was nice. Loved all the colors in this dish and what they were going for.

Firecracker shrimp, spicy garlic sauce:
This dish is not spicy, but the fried shrimp is delicious. Another dish covered in sauce.

Red pepper & feta rangoons:
They had a nice crunch and felt like a yummy crunchy and cheesy snack. I appreciated the sauce on the side.

BBQ pork belly, miso mayo pickled daikon:
It's a bit hard to share one of their steamed buns, so we each got our own. I ordered this one and enjoyed it. The bun is very thick and filling. The pork belly was quite delicious.

I had mixed feelings about the food. Some things were pretty yummy and others were just fine. A lot of things had a bit too much sauce for my liking. I felt like there was A LOT of dairy in these dishes, but that's probably due to what my friends ordered.

***PRICE***
We split the bill four ways and paid about $36.

***BATHROOM***
I only noticed one single stall here. It was gender neutral. It had a bit of a smell, but was clean otherwise. 

***CONCLUSION***
I really love the concept and what they're going for here. Some dishes are great while others don't hit the mark for me. I'd still recommend checking out this restaurant and getting things like the goat cheese dumplings and the tempura sweet potatoes.",667.0,Bang,0.9992,Tuesday

It took 15 minutes - and a request from me - to get water. The food came out pretty smoothly and it was great, with 10-15 minutes or so between each plate. But then we waited 20 minutes with just empty plates in front of us for our waitress to ask if we wanted another drink or if we were ready for the bill while we were actually still waiting for a final plate we had ordered.

I'd highly recommend checking this spot out for restaurant week it's only $35 per person and the portions are huge.  We took home enough food for two more meals.  The top hits were the bulgogi beef lettuce wraps - super tender and the kimchi was on point.  The tiki masala was packed with flavor and the Nan was obviously homemade - airy and pillowy goodness.  The goat cheese dumplings didn't disappoint - I've had them before so I knew what to expect.  The pork spring rolls were a delight unto itself.  The mushroom noodles were not a highlight - needed more heat (I'd go with the firecracker shrimp instead in hindsight).  The Brussels sprouts came out first and were tasty - your typical fried Brussel sprouts so I can't say I thought they were anything special.  There was some confusion on what was included so we ended up with 2 deserts but the comped one - we took those along with a ton of leftovers to go.  All in all a wonderful meal.  I had the season mule which was tart with a little heat - very refreshing.  My date had the blackberry bourbon drink (don't remember the name) they thoroughly enjoyed it.

Goat cheese pierogis with cilantro sauce: as a fan of goat cheese, these were just missing something. Don't know what, the dough was cooked well but just felt incomplete. Cilantro sauce didn't have much flavor.

Smoked Salmon Naan: best item of the night in my opinion! Would have been good to have toasted the naan a bit. It was just cold naan cut up into pieces.

Bulgogi lettuce wraps: greasy, fell apart. Couldn't eat as a lettuce wrap and lacked bulgogi flavor. Moreso tasted like pot roast with kimchi. Still good, but not bulgogi.

Crab Wontons: good, sauce is very sweet but complemented the crab filling.

Kale tortellini: honestly, did not like these at all. I like kale, I like brown butter. These were not tortellini like I know them (those little round stuffed pasta guys). And the flavor was just not there.

She gives a surprised look, says nothing else, then goes back to the kitchen. 15 minutes after that one of the tapas arrives. Another 15 for the tapa after that, and by this point, they actually have the waiter and food runner checking if we are still waiting for our short ribs. Not sure what was going on.

Our party of two ordered five dishes to share. We had the Chickpea Spring Rolls, General Tso's Cauliflower, Goat Cheese Dumplings, Avocado Wontons, and Pork Belly Rice. My personal favorites were the cauliflower and pork belly. In fact, the pork belly is to die for. Incredible flavors and went well with the hot and crispy rice. Cauliflower was nice and crispy too. The other dishes were just okay. I would describe the spring rolls as a very tiny Samosa wrapped like a roll. The sauce is the same sauce you would get with an Indian Samosa. Avocado Wontons and the Dumplings were okay.
 
Service was fast. Ordering is simple, but not the most interactive method. Very little communication with the servers, but receipt starts tip at 20%. So am I tipping based on just food?

The bao buns were totally raw in the center and looked more like pallid bean bags than sandwiches. Most of the tempura batter on the zucchini had run off, leaving the scalding hot vegetable with a few chunks of burnt dough clinging to the edges.

They do not have hot sake, which we were hoping for on a cold night. My only other complaint, and really it's a me thing, was that food came out really fast. We wanted to sit and enjoy the drinks, the food, the company. We were scrambling to finish and make room on our tiny two-top.

We just visited yesterday for the first time expecting a nice meal and a few drinks and was shocked by how disgustingly rude the managerial staff was. Our waitress was absolutely wonderful and very sweet but after a horrible experience with the kitchen and manager I will never return. 

We waited more than an hour and a half for our food. It was a busy night and after our appetizer, they brought one entree out 40 minutes before the rest of the food was served. One meal was completely incorrect and another cold. Our waitress said the manager agreed to give us half off our meal for the inconvenience,  then brought three incorrect bills to the table- none half off. After asking for a manager 4 times someone finally came to the table (who was clearly not a manager) to talk to us. The whole time I was explaining what happened and trying to get a correct bill, he spent rolling his eyes and looking at the bar. 

Then comes the actual manager storming over to our table and proceeded to throw a tantrum, screaming in my face , slamming his hands down on our table and even crumpling the bill and throwing it in my 16 year old sisters face. He told us to leave and never return since we refused to pay the bill (which I never once did). Once he shut up long enough for me to explain what actually happened he apologized for his behavior and the misunderstanding and we left. 

However I will NEVER return to an establishment that thinks it's ok to treat customers like that, even in a frustrating and heated situation.

398,2020-12-19,5.0,Honestly some of the best wings in town are here at Asado! I ordered 10 minutes before the kitchen closed during a cold Wednesday night which is when they have half price wings! My wings were ready in 10 minutes. I got the 12 piece which typically costs $13 or so. So worth it. The wings were cooked well and the meat was moist and flavorful inside. And then the pineapple teriyaki sauce was sweet and savory. Perfect punch. I added the loaded nachos with the beef and wow. I finished them all by myself it was that good. Worth coming back for.

If you want to avoid that maybe go to the downtown mall instead of the corner. 

Food wise, Asado is great. The wings here are unbreaded and smoked till the skin is crispy then spun graciously in sauce. I usually get the em with spicy Buffalo sauce which is pretty spicy but not to the point where it's all heat and no flavor. Indisputably the best wings Ive had in Charlottesville.

The tacos here are also very good. I'm a huge fan of the smoked pork taco which has both pineapple coleslaw and jalapeños on it which combines for a very satisfying sweet and spicy dynamic. The tacos are pretty big so if you aren't super hungry one taco might be enough food.

The wings are delicious, and come in a variety of different flavors and heat levels. The pineapple teriyaki is a personal favorite. The frozen pomegranate sangria is absolutely delicious, and incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day. If interested in a frozen drink, make sure to ask what they have currently available (usually a lime margarita plus 1-2 other options). They have many other cocktails and margarita flavors, but most are served on the rocks.

They're more like fried tortillas. Very thick. The nachos I will say we're quite satisfying to me, not the rest of our crowd though. For main, one of us got the Cajun wings and another got buffalo and bbq honey. Bro if I can tell u one thing- DONT GET THE BONELESS WINGS. I was mega looking forward to them and they tasted like they were fried once a day everyday starting two weeks ago and then frozen and refried and set under a heat lamp and then doused in the sauce.

When we ordered all the food the server looked at us confused and asked ""is this all for here or take out?"" and we were also confused and responded that it was for here. The server then reiterated that because it was Tuesday all tacos were half off so that meant we couldn't order any more - implying that what we ordered was too much for the three of us? We kind of brushed it off and ignored the server from then. The service was really slow but understandable since it was the last day of classes. When the server came with our food they only brought two of our orders while my friend was left without a order. We asked what happened to our friend's order and the server rolled their eyes and said that they ""didn't write it down"". So we obviously were annoyed and sat there and waited for my friend's order. The server came with the food and just dropped it in front of my friend spilling the contents inside the tacos and walked away without saying anything. After eating, we were all splitting the check and we simply just wanted the total to be split into three but when the server came back all the prices were extremely different even though we all ordered the same thing. This back Ajax forth happened multiple times and I was fed up and offered to just pay the whole thing and have my friends Venmo me back but my friend asked the server for the manager and the server looked upset and annoyed at this request. What annoyed me the most is that every time the server set down our ""split checks"" they were smirk at us as if they knew what they were doing and got a laugh at our annoyed reactions - really uncalled for. Thankfully, the manager was able to help us out with the checks. I have a hard time emphasizing with the server because I would understand if they were new, having a bad day, etc. but just the overall judgmental and childish attitude of the server ruined our moods. 

The food was delicious which definitely lighten up the mood. We shared pineapple teriyaki wings and honey bbq boneless wings. I usually don't like boneless but in this case I actually preferred the boneless because the chicken was extremely tender and juicy and honey bbq is always a fav.

I also tried the double smoked bacon and chicken for the first time and it was really delicious. I was pleasantly surprised. I'd still come here but I do feel that the quality went down a bit. The service is good, despite it always being busy when I come. I sat outside this time and they do have heaters so it wasn't too bad.

Two baskets of hot wings hit within 10 minutes. They offer blue cheese or ranch. I had six Pineapple teriyaki and six honey barbecue. I was blown away with the size and how tasty! Brenn followed up with another beer order and could not resist another basket of wings.

Instead of serving us or fixing our issue the servers were on their phone and talking to one another, while ignoring our table. Food took forever, and the wings were dry and tasted like they were microwaved. I've been here multiple times and the food is okay at best, but it's expensive if you don't go during a day where they have a deal. Drinks are either way too light or way too heavy, and super expensive for what you get. Glorified bar food with the same prices as DC (mid at best), overpriced Margaritas, and pretty terrible service. Would not recommend even on wing Wednesday or margarita Monday.

For appetizers we had the charred octopus which was tender and charred perfectly.  The tomato salad had a very thinly sliced and peeled tomato topped with peeled cherry tomatoes, strawberries, cheese, thin sliced sourdough crisps and greens with a pomegranate vinaigrette. The beef skewers melted in your mouth and are made with local beef.

We were excited to see manti dumplings on the menu knowing they are time consuming to make. The perfect choice for a vegetarian meal.

The burger, from local beef, was cooked perfectly as ordered and the aioli and sumac onions were a bonus. The tasty house fries were perfectly prepared served with homemade ketchup for dipping.

Most recently we ordered the rib-eye for 2. We were warned before that it takes the longest of any item on the menu to cook so expect a decent wait time (I think it was 40ish minutes) but it was WELL worth it. The steak was beautifully cooked. The sides complimented it perfectly. Our waiter showed us the steak before it was sliced for us - it just felt really nice to see how proud the restaurant was of their food and have it translate so well into an excellent tasting meal! The staff has always been incredible and welcoming every time we've visited. 

We also love their house made sparkling water. Such a Euro vibe lol! There is an extra fee to it (I think $2?) but it's added just a bit more sparkle to the dining experience.

It is narrow menu, inhabiting the past Bella's/Mangione, dramatically redone but reserving its
special tin(?) ceiling.

The meze trio, a shared starter was most notable for its properly charred eggplant; it takes a proper flame to get that flavor, a broiler will not do.   Excellent bread, described to us as made onsite. Quite so.

Manti dumplings, special, but not quite as much so as suggested...?

The fish dish 'guvec' , was a fennel based filet atop shrimp.  The fish properly prepared, just so, and the shrimp good. Perhaps to mimic a fresh caught fish you'd be served at a waterside restaurant on the Bosphorus. 

A curious baklava cheescake 'stack', unique.

I will admit that I am definitely more partial to the giant cooked meat Turkish spreads you may have to travel abroad to eat ( and dream of thereafter ), or the infinite dishes at Develi, the kunefe at Sultan Kebab, an excellent adana, or a cold doganay salgam to drink...

I have tried a lot of different Mediterranean places and upscale restaurants, but this is by far one of my top three restaurants that I have ever tried. Not only was the service amazing, and the ambience super eclectic, but the food was out of this world.

We started by ordering what the waiter recommended, and it was great because he actually knew everything about the process and where the food came from which I really appreciate when I ask the waiter what they recommend. First was a variety of oysters from different parts of the country and then bread came with different Middle Eastern dips and that was absolutely phenomenal as well as a cold soup (fyi they do charge for each extra bread you order sadly). We started to order a bunch of entrées and each one had so many different flavors and textures that we finished everything on the plate. I was even very happy to see that their mocktails and non-alcoholic beverages were abundant, and when it came out, it was as pretty as my friends who got cocktails.

The desserts that we got were out of this world. There was one with a Turkish cotton candy style flavoring that melted in our mouth, which I don't think I will ever forget. The experience was amazing and the restaurant even let us sit late because it started storming outside.

Food & drink were superb - we ordered a bunch of stuff to share & I will just list them starting with my faves, but everything was great. The unique cotton candy dessert was such a perfect end to the meal:
Manti dumplings (amazing little mini dumplings), chicken kabob (delicious seasoning), seafood main (SO MUCH juicy seafood & dippable jus), calamari in fluffy tempura-like batter, lamb kabob, heirloom tomorrow salad, mezze...great crusty bread & we appreciated the complimentary gazpacho to kick things off.

505,2023-09-25,1.0,"This place is all hype.  I brought my mother here on her birthday and it was so disappointing! The decor is swanky -- dim lights, cool music, nice bar.  So lots of mood points, but zero food points.  We ordered the charred octopus and the meze trio to start, followed by lamb skewers, manti dumplings and fisherman guvec. For drinks, we had the kusco poison. The meze trio was blah--hummus and tzatziki/labneh seemed sourced out of packets, the eggplant was smoky but otherwise unremarkable in flavor.  I baked better bread at home over the pandemic than what came with the dips.  The drink was mostly champaign with a hint of something yuzu/citrous, but just too subtle to be lively. The worst part was the 40 min. wait before the mains arrived.  The octopus was hard as a rubber hose.  We were starving so we ate it. The rest of the items were passable, but nothing that Public Oyster, Mas, Orzo, Tavola, Oakhart Social, Petit Pois, C&O, and even Maya two doors down can't serve equivalents of in a heartbeat.  The fish was the best item if I had to choose--it was perfectly cooked and the broth was complex. There is a rhythm to Aegean meze that involves generous quantities of tasty bites, some savory, some tart or sweet with delicate textures and light broths.  Accompanied by lightly charred fishes and meats and some fragrant drinks.  All doled out at a perfect pace.  This place didn't come close to that dance.  For the prices, Sultan Kebab (its sister restaurant) serves up fare that is actually worth what they charge.  The chef was very gracious.  Insisted on giving us a baklava cheesecake to make up for the disastrous octopus and the endless wait, but that cloying block of honey drenched pastry didn't make up for the lackluster experience.  I grew up on Mediterranean food in that part of the world and this is nothing like it.  Cville has too many good restaurants for this to be as buzzy as it is.",25.0,Smyrna,0.9729,Monday

We got the olives, the mezze trio and the beet salad. The olives and all the dips were phenomenal. Both the regular bread and the gluten free bread were delicious. The beet salad, however, was bad. I would not order it ever again anywhere. 

My husband and I split the three skewers. All of them were delicious. That was some of the most moist chicken I've ever had anywhere. The beef was good, nothing special. The lamb meatballs were really yummy.

Also, tried the chicken skewers for the first time. I was a bit disappointed because their menu can change seasonally, and I was banking on trying the beef skewers but they're no longer on the menu. (Lamb is still an option, though.) However, the chicken didn't let me down. They have an impressive char flavor and are juicy and flavorful. Even the garnish and sauce were incredible.

My only thought in improvement was very minor, and I feel like I'm splitting hairs with this one. The gazpacho, although delicious, I wished packed a bit more of that tart/sour cherry flavor advertised on the menu.

I got the Riviera cocktail- a Bombay gin, Pimm's cup, lavender lemonade, and cucumber slices mix. Absolutely loved it! It tasted so refreshing in the summer heat. The Paasionera was great too, though a little strong for my taste. 

The complimentary hummus and bread was delicious. The bread was soft and the hummus was mixed just right. The bruschetta was beautifully prepped and very satisfying as well!

Our server Annie was new on the job and apologized in advance but that was not needed as she was super sweet, attentive and helpful!

She brought out olives for us to enjoy before, but no bread since I let her know I was gluten free. 

For gluten free options, they do not have a gf pasta, but any of meats can be prepared gf and the risotto is gluten free. 

We enjoyed sangria and when Annie asked if we were from Cville, we told her no and we were visiting on vacation so she recommended several spots. 

My friend had the spring vegetable salad and loved the lentils on the salad and ate every bit of her Calamarata alla Norma.  I enjoyed the Risotto Primavara.

Best tiramisu I have ever had. We received many compliments on the food, the wine, and local beer selection. The staff was professional, friendly and helpful.

We came here for date night, courtesy of a very generous wedding gift from the owners. The prosciutto bruschetta was exactly what I want an appetizer to be- tasty, but not filling to the point I'm not hungry for my entree.

The Lamb itself was superb. Lamb is my favorite meat, so I obviously have high standards for it. Orzo's dish was so tender I didn't even need a knife to cut it.

Our party of 6 had an early dinner reservation, and we weren't quite hungry enough for a meal when we got there but somehow managed to eat a TON of food. It was that delicious! To be honest, nothing on the menu really stood out to me at first but EVERYTHING we ordered was so appetizing and amazing.

We started with the mussels as an appetizer and the broth was so rich and sausage-y. We also got the haloumi cheese and hummus apps... everything was sooo good that we ordered another full loaf of bread and oil to dip in all of the leftover broth, cheese, and hummus. Even the olive oil was the best oil I've ever tasted. Our sirloin steak, pork tenderloin, and rigatoni bolognese entrees were really great too and so flavorful. Tiramisu and drinks did not disappoint either, although I wasn't a big fan of the sangria. Would def come here again, and I found that this place was only one of a few that opens on Sunday and Monday evenings in Cville.",292.0,Orzo,0.9932,Friday
562,2021-10-31,5.0,"We were visiting my son in Charlottesville and he recommended the Orzo for dinner so we gave it a try.  It was a great call!  I'm going to concentrate on my dish but before I do I just want to praise the hummus a bit.  We actually ordered two hummus dishes - we had one as an appetizer with the baguette, and my wife had a hummus order but substituted grilled flatbread instead of the baguette.  Haven't had hummus on a baguette before but it was fun and delicious.  Of course what made it great was the hummus - very flavorful, light and fresh.  We ate every drop of the hummus and all loved it.
 
My dish was the Smoked Pork Tenderloin.  It was fantastic.  The chef had laid down the butternut squash puree with the chili fennel rub/bulgur pilaf on top, and the green apple relish on the side (see photo).  I started with the rub/pilaf/puree and the explosion of flavors was just incredible.  So delicious!  And the apple relish had a wonderful, light, minty(?), refreshing flavor but was chopped into very small little cubes so that it was also a delight to chew.  Mixing the relish in with the rub/pilaf/puree was just a flavor smorgasbord.  

Then there was the tenderloin.  Very tender, not a bit of fat on it, cooked perfectly, and with a strong and delicious smoked flavor.  It would have been delicious all by itself, but with the accompanying delights just mentioned, it was out of the park!   Couldn't have been happier with the tenderloin, it was the best I've ever had.
 
The only knock I have on the Orzo was the list of entrees is a bit short.  I suspect they keep it short to concentrate on what they serve, and they did an outstanding job on my tenderloin, but newcomers may have an easier time selecting something with a couple more choices.  All in all, it was just outstanding and I can't wait to go back.",34.0,Orzo,0.9985,Sunday

Prosciutto bruschetta was SO good. A must have. I could've eaten only those for the whole meal and would be okay with that. My boyfriend had a bolognese which was very fragrant and yummy. The squid pasta was also very good. The squid was very tender and softer than the noodle. There was no fishy smell or taste and it paired very well with the wine that our waitress so kindly suggested to us. The cake was also very good and moist. It was served with lemon curd and whipped cream which felt like clouds. Overall food was amazing and service was also amazing, as our waitress continued to check in on us.",15.0,Orzo,0.9858,Friday

They have an interesting menu, loaded with some really nice Italian/Mediterranean style eats. Prices are decent, but on the slightly high side.

I started with their Greek salad from their specialty menu and it was outstanding! Next I moved on to their hummus, which comes with their freshly made baguette and it was great! The texture of the hummus was a little more coarse than I prefer, but the flavor was great and the baguette was excellent too.

Their Red Wine Braised, Calamarata Squid Pasta dish was very interesting! The taste and spice of chorizo and smoked paprika was mostly what I experienced and I really enjoyed it. The squid was cooked perfectly and wasn't hard nor rubbery. For dessert I enjoyed their Pot de crème and it was outstanding! While there I tried a glass of wine and a cocktail and enjoyed both.

If you like fruity cocktails the pomelo is what I would recommend. 
For our food we ordered the peasant beef pasta and the red wine braised lamb. I expected the lamb to be lamb chops but came out a little different. But none the less it was VERY tender and very yummy. The pasta was also tasty.

579,2022-06-19,5.0,"This was our first time dining at Orzo and it was simply incredible! The main thing we raved about (both during and long after dinner) was how flavorful all of the food was. 

The Food
Our sever recommended the grilled halloumi cheese and I would be lying if I said we still aren't thinking about it 3 days later. Such a unique and delicious dish--I wound up drinking the remaining broth with a spoon, it was THAT good! I indulged in the summer orecchiette pasta which was so light and flavorful with delightful pops of broccolini, tomato, and chickpeas. The lemon ricotta was subtle and added just enough creaminess to the dish without making it too overwhelming. My boyfriend ordered the spice rubbed pork chop and we both agreed it was the most delicious pork chop we've ever tasted! The crunchy sear bursting with flavor perfectly complimented the juicy interior--it was quite an experience. We also had a small tray of appetizers olives which will surpass anything you'll buy jarred in a grocery store. I could have snacked on them all day. We wrapped up dinner with a classic tiramisu, perfectly portioned to share between the two of us. Lastly, I ordered the Napoleon's Loss cocktail with perfect ratios of tequila, ginger, and lemon. A nice heavy pour and tasty candied ginger garnish--delish! 

The Service
We absolutely loved our server and I am so sad I don't remember his name. He was so pleasant, accommodating, and knowledgeable of the menu. We have absolutely no complaints. Early in the night, a different server dropped off a drink saying it was the Napoleon's Loss, but within seconds of me about to sip it, I believe it was the manager who ran over and told me it was wrong drink and quickly went to get me the right one. The level that the staff cares about their customers was abundantly clear, and we felt very well taken care of.

The Space
Parking was a breeze. We parked in the lot next to the building and didn't have any issues finding a spot at 6:30pm on a Friday. There was a shaded patio which looked airy and fun, but I had made our reservation for inside. The inside was intimate in appearance and a little loud with the acoustics, but it was not difficult to still enjoy our anniversary date. 

Thank you so much, Orzo, for a wonderful experience! We can't wait to come back the next time we are in Charlottesville.",245.0,Orzo,0.9937,Sunday
580,2022-07-06,4.0,Great covered outdoor patio. Tons of free parking in the adjacent lot. The lamb ($30) was incredibly tender but could've used a bit more seasoning to balance out the sweetness of the figs. The bolognese ($19) was delicious and perfectly al dente. The burrata ($12) over a bed of farro with a balsamic glaze was a good starter to share. Tiramisu ($8) was the best thing we ordered.

582,2022-08-02,4.0,"Delicious food, good service and nice atmosphere. We chose this for a Friday night on a girls' weekend trip and vibe felt just right.  The pace is pretty slow, which was fine for our group. 

One reason this loses a star is two of us ordered cocktails that weren't great. I got the pasionaria, which is somewhat like a margarita with tequila, elderwater flower liquor and rimmed in harissa salt. I didn't like the salt at all and would have greatly preferred a simpler margarita. My friend got the ravello and she didn't like it. I took one sip and it jerked me back; I was expecting a strong lemon flavor but it was just like an alcohol burn without any pleasant flavor. 

Now, the peasant beef and pork bolognese was so good! The portion was smaller than I expected (all entree servings were), but it was rich and enough for me and I would definitely order again.

For dessert, we shared a chocolate pot de creme and omg! Again, it looked pretty small to share at our table, but it was so rich. I think I made a verbal yum sound after each bite.",215.0,Orzo,0.9896,Tuesday

I worked in the restaurant service for several years. I understand what it's like when patrons are rude or entitled. For what it's worth, we were not like that. We just walked inside a dark and totally unoccupied restaurant. Not another soul around. 

Whatever we did when we entered made that individual quite annoyed. Or maybe he was already annoyed. We will not be back because of it.

We came in recently for a date night, and noticed the food hasn't quite kept up. The grilled halloumi cheese appetizer was fabulous, but the entrees leave much to be desired. We had the lamb shank bourguignon and the grilled prime sirloin steak and unfortunately both were just meh. The lamb was cooked very well, but our overall impression was they were both pretty boring. The flavors were run of the mill. I will dream about the pork medallions I had last year - one of the best meals I've had. Until that comes back, the rest of their entrees seem to be good, but not great.

It's always been very tasty -- well-prepared, properly seasoned, and hot. The bruschetta appetizer is especially delicious. I get it every time. But something was different about this last visit. We arrived 12 minutes early for our 7:30 reservation, and were told quite firmly that we would be seated no earlier than 7:30. Ok, not a problem. So we sat at the completely empty bar to wait the 12 minutes. The host then offered my wife a menu, which she declined. The host then said it won't get us seated any faster. Really? Why are you treating us like we did something wrong? It's not like we were 12 minutes LATE for the reservation. Thank you but we can do without the attitude. Once seated, we decided to order our appetizers while we decided on the entrees. The waiter told us we couldn't do that. He said we had to order everything at the same time. Seriously? In decades of dining out, I've never had that happen before. While the food is excellent, we prefer to dine somewhere where we feel welcome.

613,2023-07-31,3.0,"The food is food and I appreciate the nonstandard menu. I ordered the Go Fig or Go home mocktail, primarily because there was fig in it but I did not detect any fig flavor. It was still tasty though like a refreshing fizzy water, but not fig water. My recommendation to the restaurant when making this mocktail, however, is to please stir the drink before serving it or suggest the patron stir it. When I took my first couple sips, all I tasted was bland soda water. It wasn't until I stirred the drink several times when I finally tasted what I think it was supposed to taste like.

I had the Shawarma Spiced Grilled Fish of the Night which was swordfish. That was done very nicely since swordfish tends to be a bit of a dense fish. It wasn't dry at all and the rub they used was delicious. I don't like fish (only ordered it because I thought it'd be a healthy choice, but I liked this dish.  I also enjoyed the sweet potato that came with it. The sweet potatoes are a few thick round slices of sweet potato that were naturally sweet. I could have done without the beet tzatziki though. I think it was the color (pink like pepto bismol). It made sense that it was pink because tzatziki is white and beets are a dark red, but still, the color looked very unnatural. 

I can see why the Peasant Beef & Pork Bolognese is ordered often. It was quite good, and the portion size was just right.

The ambiance was a bit distracting. The restaurant  inside what looked like what used to be a hangar or warehouse, so when you look up, instead of seeing a ceiling, you see a curved metal roof. There is an open kitchen concept but perhaps a bit too open for me, as if the team was cooking feet away from you in the same room but not in a kitchen. The lighting could also be better. It was a bit too dim/dark, and the dark colored wood furnishings did not help.

I found the service distracting as well. Our server placed two small plates in front of us (presumably for our appetizers). Shortly thereafter, another server came up to ours and whispered to him with a disapproving facial expression and pointed to our table. This exchange occurred directly in front of me. The other server then removed those two plates without comment. I expected a ""pardon my reach"" or ""excuse me"" or ""I'm sorry, these plates were not supposed to be placed on your table."" Also, two different people brought our food to the table. Each person had a ""I'd much rather be somewhere else"" or ""this is such a chore"" expression on their faces.

I declined to discuss it with anyone that worked there as it was fairly busy, and the waitstaff were not exactly attentive to us (besides the bartender).

I also had the duck fat potatoes which were fine but not crispy the way duck fat cooked potatoes should be. What is the point of the duck fat if not done properly?!

Better impression: appetizers comes out within 5-10 mins after being ordered, in a packed-from-the-back-to-front of restaurant. Classic Minestrone Soup? Delicious. 18 Month Prosciutto di Parma Bruschetta? Freakin better than any bruschetta I've had in the past 2 years. 

Entrees were what stood out to me. 

Spaghetti pomodoro was just perfect. Balanced. Frequent hits of Basil touched the palate. Banger dish. 

Grilled Marinated Pork Tenderloin with whatever the hell dried cherry mostardo is (later I found out it's basically fruit and mustard), delicious. Oh and there's a hidden layer of smoked aioli. SMOKED AIOLI freakin smacked me in the face. The entire plate was cohesive af. 

Dessert. 
-Pot de creme: simple with two ingredients yet so so good. I'm going to attempt to recreate this at home. 
-Spanish Olive Oil & Rosemary Cake with the lemon curd. To die for.

peasant beef and pork bolognese: great pasta texture and even spread of meat, flavorful, definitely my favorite of the night

grilled fish: happened to be salmon, which was super tender. came with some tomato slices and potato, which was a great add on. really delicious, but wish there was a bit more fish for the cost

The same restaurant that is too small to fit all of its guest so they open up the middle of the waiting room of Feast to sit their guests? Is this the same restaurant with only one working bathroom not situated inside of the restaurant? Is Orzo not the restaurant that offers chewy and utterly inedible steak? The only meal that fits right in is the Peasant Beef and Pork Bolognese, because I sure felt like a peasant eating here.

639,2024-06-26,3.0,"Meh. We were at another restaurant having drinks and decided to hoof it over here bc the pasta was supposed to be amazing... We will never know. Sat at the bar and ordered a glass of rosé, which was sensational btw, but when we first sat down the bartender was pretty short. We sat down and he said ""I'm not ready for you yet"" and walked away. It was really odd. I understand that you have a full bar and you're very busy but just communicate properly "" hey guys, welcome in, I'm working on a couple drinks right now, do you mind if I come back down to you in a minute?"" that's all that needed to be said not, ""I'm not ready for you.""

When he came back and I got the sensational glass of rosé, we were ready to put in our appetizer before deciding on our main entrée. We ordered the appetizer and then asked us what we'd like for our entrée, we said we're still debating the entrée and will order later, he said ok and walked away. Two minutes later he came back and asked ""are you ready to order your entrée"", and we replied ""no we're going to wait until we have our appetizer and then we'll put in our entrée."" He said "" I have to put it all in at once so I'm not gonna put your appetizer in until you order your entrée"". So strange since we were both sitting there waiting on the appetizer we thought we had put in ... If he hadn't informed us of this we would've been waiting a long time! I complained about it to the woman sitting next to me, who was listening to the entire transaction, just shrugged. This was the second ding she heard me mention about our short time there.

The bartender could send the dissatisfaction of having to order everything at once and then started to explain that it's because the kitchen gets backed up and when you put in your appetizer and entrée separately it kicks back to square one and it could take 45 minutes to come out. Again, if that has been communicated at the beginning of ordering, this wouldn't have been an issue. It's like when you go to a Spanish restaurant, and they tell you the paella will take 45 minutes to cook so that you have an expectation. Just communicate.

It gets weirder! Right after this interaction, while sitting at the bar, I started to draft my Yelp review.  I even pushed back a bit and held my phone at an angle so the bartender didn't see as to not be rude. As I'm in the middle of drafting my yelp review, the host looks over and says ""what are you writing? ""And I didn't know how to respond so I said ""my yelp review ... what are you writing"" and then in what seemed like a power-play, he said btw I'm the owner and have you met my wife... She's sitting right next to you. Apparently, I was sitting next to his wife and daughter at the bar the whole time and she was the one I mentioning the bartender was being rude and that I couldn't believe we had to put our whole order in at one time. 
In that moment, I was so taken aback by his comment on my yelp review and then making me feel so awkward with his ""power-play "". But in true fashion, I dug back in and told his wife ""I don't regret what I said / the bartender was curt and it's ridiculous to have to order everything at once, that's not what dining out is about and it doesn't make it enjoyable. Further had he just communicated properly then it would have been a perfectly pleasant experience"".

Walking in on a Saturday evening, there were 3 of us without a reservation, but that didn't seem like an issue as we were seated almost immediately. The ambiance and aesthetics were nice!

We all ordered our own entree, but we started off with the hummus which came with some nice warm bread. It wasn't pita bread so I was surprised, but it tasted really good. My friend was right about the hummus, it was definitely a hit! I can see why he will just go to Orzo sometimes for the hummus only.

For my entree, I ordered the Saffron Risotto which can be tricky to make, but once again, a hit! Orzo really made it taste great and it was a perfect sized portion as well.

3,2009-08-11,5.0,"This was a hard decision between 4 and 5 stars. It wasn't perfect... but if I'm honest, for the area... this actually is perfect.  

First, the food was dead on.  From the bread, to the salad, to the steak, it was all flavored beautifully and expertly from a true professional... not someone who wanted to make mass-produced comfort food, but someone who wanted to make delicious, complex yet accessible food.  Who can't get on board with that?

The atmosphere was a bit more dingy than i was led to believe from previous reviews.  It looks and feels almost like a diner that spent a few hundred bucks trying to make it look nice within an evening.  Like trying to set up for a dinner party in a rundown shack with only a few hours to prepare.  Reminds me of an episode of I Love Lucy or something.  It works here though, it keeps a casual, comfortable, yet open atmosphere that prepares you for a high-class, freshly prepared meal.  Perfect for Charlottesville.

The drink list is extensive, and the wine list is as well.  The desserts are ok, but nothing too exciting.  

The service is outstanding by the way.  A knock on the place is that while it isn't 'expensive,' it is a bit more than you'd find anywhere else in this area.  Still going to be pricey, but just to summarize the argument, its 100% worth it.

Its a great place, and much much more than you could realistically expect out of such a place.  This place is somewhere you can go to several times a week, or just once and always be satisfied and content.  Its a great place to be.  If you're out in this area, don't bother going anywhere else.",87.0,Duners,0.9978,Tuesday
4,2009-09-02,5.0,"With Duner's, it's all about the food.  This venerable Ivy restaurant does not boast an elegant dining room.  The casual wait staff does not fawn over or pamper its guests.  And the kitchen abstains from over-the-top trendy creative culinary endeavors.  Instead, Duner's focuses - and delivers - on sourcing outstanding ingredients and skillfully preparing confident, delicious fine dining dishes.  

Open nightly for dinner from 5 'til 10, Duner's consists of a main dining room featuring booths along two walls and four-top tables in the middle.  There's a smaller dining room to the right.  The décor and place settings are somewhat plain and Spartan but its comfortable nonetheless.  

The menu is created daily based upon the kitchen's ingredients and whims of the chef.  It typically consists of nearly a dozen choices of both appetizers ($8 to $9) and entrees ($19 to $26).  Vegetarian and pasta dishes are always offered as well as sandwiches ($11).  

The challenge is choosing among the wonderfully tempting and deliciously composed dishes.  On a recent experience, we struggled mightily to select our meal.  From the appetizers, we narrowed it down to a short-list of choices that included house-made gnocchi, grilled scallops, steamed mussels and tempura soft shell crab.  We decided on the grilled scallops which were served with a basil and lime cream sauce.  

The scallops were expertly prepared: sweet and plump, well seasoned and perfectly cooked to an ideal consistency.  Sadly, too many kitchens destroy this delicate ingredient through overcooking or allowing the just-cooked scallops to sit too long on the plate before being served, resulting in something that's at-best dry or at-worst rubbery.  The dish was served with a sublime sauce whose richness and slight hint of citrus nicely complimented the caramelized, salty outer surface of the scallop.  

The same dilemma faced us for our entrée selections.  In the running were crabcakes, soft shell crabs, snapper and beef tenderloin.  Our waitress offered that the chef excelled at fish, so that helped to slightly narrow it down for us.  My dining companion chose the snapper which was flash-fried whole and beautifully presented surrounded by pepper sambal (or relish).  We tend to grill fish whole, so taking the flesh off the bone was not disconcerting at all.  The fish tasted very fresh and the simplicity of the preparation allowed the ingredient to stand alone.  The relish, was arranged along the circumference of the plate in alternating palettes of red and yellow - a beautiful visual rendering of summer colors.  

I chose the soft shell crabs which were - hands down - the best soft shells I've ever had.  First and foremost, they were incredibly fresh, lacking that ""fishy"" taste one often experiences with soft shells.  That's because it's difficult to get really fresh ones: it requires timing and precision from waterman to processor, distributor and chef.  To be sure, the little devils must be eaten within two days of crawling out of its hard shell.  Duner's sourced these crabs brilliantly.  Not only were the crabs fresh but they were also prepared beautifully.  Expertly flash-fried, still-crisp and, mercifully, not the least bit oily.  The only other place in Charlottesville that has mastered frying at this level of sophistication is Bang! (at least the last time we dined there).  The crabs were served perched upon a warm ""salad"" consisting of potatoes, corn and avocado which was ""dressed"" with a creamy herb and bacon sauce.  The dish had the dichotomic distinction of being both delicate and decadent.  Truly outstanding.        

Duner's offers a nice selection of beer, wine and booze.  A rose, offered by the glass, paired well with our selections and its light hue looked lovely in the glass.  We completed the meal with espresso which was strong but thankfully lacked the obnoxious bitterness of some shots.

Duner's does not accept reservations, so pick the day and time you visit carefully.  Or, stop in, add your name to the list and order a drink at the bar, or wait outside and make friends with others seeking a table.  Dress is casual - you'll see everything from suits and dresses to jeans, shorts golf shirts and sundresses.   

At Duner's the food does the talking.  Bravo!  One of our best meals of the year!",59.0,Duners,0.999,Wednesday
5,2009-09-28,4.0,"Very tasty meal. Went intent on getting seafood and they had a fairly wide variety available.

Started out with the butternut squash soup, which was very thick (which is good) and more filling than it appears. Plus, on the cold and rainy day we went, it was very warming. It's topped with crème fraîche and sage which gave it a richer, deeper flavor.

For appetizers we had the mussels and also the scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the ancho & mushroom sauce was spicy without being overwhelming. The mussels, I don't know how you review mussels, except that they didn't give me food poisoning. I try not to look at them too much when I eat them, but I enjoyed the taste.

For the main meal we split the entree of crab cakes, which were awesome. It was like they just took a handful of crab meat, battered it up and fried it. No filler. The mashed potatoes and cole slaw on the side were both nicely done.

And our waitress, in splitting the meal, nicely gave us both full portions of the sides along with our individual crab cake. I thought that was pretty cool, and they didn't charge extra for it.

The potatoes were creamy, no lumps. The cole slaw was finely shredded and not creamy. Just a nice vinegary pepper taste.

Also on the side they give you a scoop of tartar sauce nearly the same size as the crab cake. I don't know who eats that much tartar sauce, but the little bit I had was a-ok.

The salad I could have either done without or had earlier in the meal, but it honestly had no real impact on my enjoyment.

For service, our waitress was very attentive, glasses were refilled often enough without it being intrusive and fresh bread (which was actually fresh baked) was brought without asking and refilled when low.

Overall a very enjoyable experience, which yes is kind of pricey, but I've also spent double that elsewhere for pretty near the same level of quality.",10.0,Duners,0.9956,Monday
6,2009-10-13,4.0,"Duner's is an interesting place.  It's like going to a big family gathering where everyone pulls out the card tables and gets served an amazing meal.  It's no frills- the atmosphere is white tablecloth but cheap wooden chairs.  You can pony up to the bar on $10 wooden stools.  But the food makes it all worth while.  It's a great menu that includes several fish dishes (grouper, flounder, salmon), pork, duck, lamb and a handful of steak options.  There was also some pasta and a vegetarian dish. All are fairly classic in approach- nothing wacky.  I had the lamb - it was seasoned very nicely and cooked to order.  It was a lot of food- I received 7 ribs in a red wine reduction over a roasted red pepper crepe.  Very nice.  My wife had a beef tenderloin with bleu cheese.  It was rich and decadent.

The reasons for 4 stars and not 5 were really the ambiance and the dessert.  Desserts were a bit lacking.  But overall its probably one of the better meals in the area and I'd go back again.  My tab with one appetizer, 2 glasses of wine, 2 entrees and 2 desserts was about $100 even.  So pretty good value too.

8,2011-06-01,2.0,"Everyone's favorite restaurant in Charlottesville is not mine. It is a definite 2, not a 3.

I ordered flank steak and when it was delivered to the table it was luke warm, at best. Anyone who knows me knows I like my hot food HOT - who wants cold beef? The waitress took the plate away and ten minutes later served me a ""new"" dish, which consisted of the same meat, reheated. Not only was I disturbed by this, but the meat was now way overcooked. The flavor was decent, but the chewy factor ruined the dish for me.

What Duner's does do well is their homemade ranch dressing and brussel sprouts - I was impressed with those items. I had heard the bread was amazing, but, truth be told, it was a muted version of some type of Pillsbury dough.

We decided to order dessert - a brownie coffee-ice cream sandwich. I am not sure where they put the coffee flavoring, but where that was lacking there was a cup of chocolate syrup to try to make up for it - it was smothered.

All in I would give Duner's another chance, but my expectations would be much lower. It is likely one of Charlottesville's best restaurants, but I'm not sure that's saying much...",120.0,Duners,0.9584,Wednesday
9,2012-08-31,5.0,"In the middle of my host's vehement discussion on the differences between regular cow and the tragic, glorious Texan longhorn, I looked up from my plate for the first time that evening. Yes I should have been paying more attention but it always feels so weird to be staring at someone whilst chewing, and so I listened with one ear open and the other senses completely fixated on my food. Much like a potbelly pig does. 

Scallops were divine. I had no idea something that came from the butt of a mollusk could taste so good. I've been watching Hell's Kitchen on repeat, and it boggles my mind how badly trained chefs can burn, over-season, under-season, and otherwise mutilate a poor little scallop. I would tell you to just come here and order two plates of the scallops and not to share with anyone, no, not even your children, because they're that delicious. The tomato/mozz plate was your typical kind of yum (with LOCAL tomatoes - so local, they were planted, plucked, and nurtured from someone's backyard). 

I got the grilled hanger steak. Nice to see that it came slightly bloody in the middle. I wish they gave me more roasted potatoes, though, because those micro-roasted tubers were awesome. I think someone asked me if they could have half of one, and I was like ... you can have the skin? I know, I am dreadful. 

Food came fast; wine and water continuously replenished. One thing that did grate a bit on my nerves was that the waitress had no idea of how to gracefully interrupt a conversation with some update on the food. We would be in the middle of something, and she would just lean her head way in and start rambling or stick her arm across someone's plate to reach the wine. Granted, the table we were seated at was a bit awkward to navigate, but she was so obtrusive! Otherwise, a magnificent dining experience.",1420.0,Duners,0.9758,Friday
10,2012-09-02,3.0,"I want to love Duner's, I really do. I've been there maybe 10 times in the last 2 years, because it's convenient, and because the very first time I went, I had a pasta dish that knocked my socks off. I've been trying, in vain, to recreate that first magical meal.
Duner's seems to be somewhat hit or miss. The food is never BAD, it just often misses the mark, especially on the main courses. I can't figure out exactly what the problem is, but my dining partner agrees completely. Often it seems like a dish is missing maybe just one ingredient that could have pulled the rest of the dish together, instead leaving you with something that seems like it should be great, but instead came out just ok.

Also, the salad dressings are often pretty poor. Avoid anything that sounds a little more exotic, and stick with ranch or something else basic. I've had a feta-basil dressing and a green goddess dressing that were just awful.

The best things on the menu are the appetizers, which are consistently excellent. The fried panko oysters and the steamed mussels are excellent. The homemade bread is great. Soups are also good--their gumbo is outstanding.

Also, we had a dessert there recently that was out of this world--Warm apple crisp with pecan streusel topping, whipped cream, and vanilla sauce. Best dessert I've ever eaten. Kudos to their pastry chef.

A few other criticisms: they're going to charge the prices they do, they really need to update the interior of the place. The booths are really old, scarred up, and uncomfortable; the flooring is outdated and grungy, and the bar badly needs to be replaced.  At the very least, they need a paint job in there. I hate paying $70 plus dollars for a meal for two in an interior that deserves about $15.  It's also incredibly crowded in there if you sit at a table and not a booth. 
And finally, the service varies wildly. We've had nice waitstaff, and borderline rude waitstaff. In general, it's also slow, so don't go if you're in a hurry.",15.0,Duners,0.9885,Sunday

14,2015-08-29,4.0,"Duner's is a little bit of a drive out of the city down Ivy Road but is a Charlottesville staple. It was highly recommended by several people, so we decided to go there for a nice birthday meal for my boyfriend. It's a pretty cozy place, and the parking lot was full, so I was a bit worried we weren't going to be able to get a table. There was only one available when we walked in, so they were able to seat us right away. Just a note, they do not take reservations.

They have white cloth tables, so it feels like you are dining at a fancy place, but the ambiance created is a little bit off. The tables are pretty close together, and they need better lighting or something. I'm one that goes to a place more for the food than the ambiance, so I was okay with it. They served us warm homemade bread with butter while we were pouring over the menu. There were so many great options and the menu changes daily, so I couldn't plan out what to order ahead of time, and I had a very hard time narrowing down what I wanted!

We ordered a bottle of malbec from Mendoza. The appetizers were the easy part to agree on--we went with fried oysters and fried green tomatoes (a little birthday tradition of ours). The malbec was meh, but the starters were amazing. I loved the aoili that was paired with both dishes, and they complemented each other well. I'm on kind of a fried oyster kick, and these were awesome! Each entree comes with a side salad, and the dressings are all made in house. I went with the Russian and was slightly disappointed by it. For my main, I finally settled on the tuna. I ordered it chef's choice, and it was cooked slightly more than I would have preferred it. It was served over tasso, mushroom, potato, and kalmata olive hash. The hash was such an interesting combination of flavors, and the dish itself was super rich. The dish was done really well, but I couldn't decide if I liked the unique flavors. Now, thinking back to this dish, I actually really, really liked it. My boyfriend ordered the veal scaloppini and was a big fan.

First impressions were positive of the very quaint building that wasn't fancy but had a clean, dressed up diner feel. I'm still unsure, but it seemed as though some people had reservations even though when I called I was told no reservations were taken. No worries, the bar and the very pleasant bartender was a nice place to wait as we started a bottle of wine. One thing that we both found interesting was that every patron seemed to also be eligible for AARP benefits.... they clearly had a target audience but it made it a much nicer, quiet ambiance. 

The menu was clearly seafood focused, but had a variety for all palates. The fried oysters appetizer was the highlight of the meal! I'm personally a raw oysters fan, but for the GF who isn't they were a good compromise. Our entrees were good, and the wait staff was pleasant. 

Overall I'd say this was a standard, typical dinning experience. It was good food, expected bill of just over $100 before tip (bottle of wine included), but without reservations and the drive out of Cville I don't expect to be back more than a couple times a year. 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4 since it's nice to see somewhere focused towards locals and regulars.",160.0,Duners,0.9861,Friday

Our friends had the beef tenderloin and duck which were pronounced superb.  The only not great thing was the tomato soup (ok not a stand out) Overall portions were very filling.
Great service.  will return soon.",51.0,Duners,0.9688,Thursday
26,2017-10-23,4.0,"This restaurant is one of our family's favorites. We try to come here whenever everyone is in town and highly recommend it to any family wanting a nice meal out. The food is seasonal, great tasting, and generous. While the prices are a bit high, it's reasonable compared to other nice options in Charlottesville. The wait staff is incredibly personable, helpful, and hospitable. 

Some dishes that I recommend are the oyster appetizer, which comes fried golden brown with a great remoulade sauce, the homemade fettuccini with signature Italian sausage in a fragrant tomato creen sauce, the savory, herbed roasted duck, and the veal scallopini. This particular time we also tried the seared scallops with a light orange hoisin sauce, which passed our expectation.

Overall, this local eatery provides a great experience that cuts through the noise of Charlottesville's diverse food scene.",101.0,Duners,0.9841,Monday

We started with a massive bowl of mussels in a garlic butter wine sauce. The mussels themselves were super fresh and huge. Great appetizer to share.  We also had a few draft beers from Devils BB. 

I had Crispy Fried Whole Flounder with korean bbq dippin sauce over veggie lo-mein.  Talk about unique!  I've never seen a full flounder on a menu.... snapper sure, but not flounder. Overall the dish was awesome and this was perfect. The crispy skin was the best part.  I found the korean bbq sauce to be very salty and acidic and didn't use any of it; however, the dish didnt need any extra sauce/flavor. 

She ordered the seared salmon over spinach and potato gnocchi with prosciutto and corn.  The fish was perfectly cooked, buttery and delicious, Overall the plate was incredibly rich and succulent and she scarfed it down in about 1.5 seconds. Hey, it was her birthday..... 
 
Perhaps the best part was lovely waitress. She share some terrific suggestions/highlights, was super friendly, and in true Duner's laidback fashion she wore a simple t-shirt, apron and jeans.",379.0,Duners,0.9979,Monday

We shared the calamari which was lightly breaded and came with a ginger wasabi dipping sauce - a pleasant change from typical marinara or aioli sauces. I got the seared salmon, and it was perfectly cooked (not dry at all and with just the right amount of lemon beurre blanc sauce) and was accompanied by housemade gnocchi. My husband had the ribeye which was prepared at the perfect medium rare and upgraded to the special vegetable side of brussel sprouts and spinach.

Overall, deliciously prepared dishes, nice staff, extensive wine list, and lovely but not stuffy ambiance. Definitely one of our new favorite restaurants for special dinners in the area!

34,2018-04-06,5.0,"Wow!!! Best dining in Charlottesville. The food here is better than Hamilton and Main, better than C&O, better than Public Fish...I could go on and on. I visited on a weeknight about 8:30. So, I didn't have to face the crowd. There was no wait. I still decided to sit at the bar. I started with the Brussels sprouts dish. It's not on the appetizer menu. It's listed as a side at the bottom of the menu. This was the star of the night for me. Most Brussels sprout dishes are roasted and have smoky flavors. Duners' take on Brussel sprouts was a subtlety bold flavor. And I imagine they were braised. It had delicious broth and was cooked with spinach...man so good.  Next, I had a house salad, which comes with the entree, and the house bread. I believe the bread is a sourdough. It was really warm and doughy just like I like my bread. Soooo yummy. The salad was standard fare.  I wished they tossed the salad for you. It would have made it easier to eat (the salad comes with a dollop of the dressing on top of the bed of greens). But once I tossed the salad and cut up the huge leaves, twas delicious!!! I had my salad with the mustard vinegariette. It was perfect. I really had a hard time picking an entree because everything looked delicious. But I went with the tenderloin and potatoes. Really really good choice. The star of that dish to me were actually the onions that accompanied the dish. But I love onions. I topped the night off with the dome cake which is best if you have someone to share it with. It's huge!!!! Totally forgot to take a picture.

Those are my only two downfalls about this place. I would definitely visit again if I were in the area. We had a house salad to begin. Shortly after there was calamari for the appetizer.

Seriously, it was to die for. The fish was perfectly cooked and the dish had all the right notes. It was rich and filling, comforting and everything I needed in that moment. Husband had homemade fettuccini with duck meatballs and mushroom spinach cream sauce. Suuuuppppeerrrr delicious. Who knew that duck meatballs could be so perfect? 
Apparently Duner's, and they are doing it right. The atmosphere is comfortable, not stuffy, and the staff are very attentive, a total win-win.

The inside has wooden booths and while you may see someone in a suit you may see someone in a T-shirt and jeans. It's casual and unpretentious. Moreover, the service is fantastic and will make you feel at home. 

I usually get something different each time I come. One thing I have been getting more consistently is the calamari appetizer. It is lightly fried with a delicious sauce.

Once inside, it's French country meets local dive. Crisp, white tablecloths and very uncomfortable wooden booths and chairs.. The whole place needs room dampening. It's crazy loud.

We always order mussels on any menu and we agreed that these were probably the best we have ever had overall.  You could drink the delicious broth they are cooked in or just soak the wonderful House made bread in it and eat it like we did.  

They gave us complimentary champagne and pumpkin cheesecake which was totally unnecessary but speaks to the thoughtfulness of this restaurants staff and ownership.

You did nothing even though everyone was watching this particularly long table which could have easily been relocated into the tent room.You inflicted this screaming child on over 100 diners each paying $200 or more a cover. When my child acted like that we immediately exited the restaurant because we knew that just the change in temperature calmed them down. And then they could return. We also realized that at about age 2 we could no longer take them to a nice restaurant for a year or so until they were able to behave.

78,2022-09-05,3.0,"Duner's enjoys an excellent reputation and is usually a memorable choice for a dinner out.  However, a recent Sunday experience was less than noteworthy.  I was surprised at how many menu choices were no longer available that day and when you look forward to trying something, its absence dampens your enthusiasm for the meal.  I found the soup a little bland and not particularly creamy; and the mussels were not as fresh as one would hope. The bread was its usual example of excellence. I wondered if some of the remaining menu items were more ""ready to serve"" offerings that can be stored, such as the short rib.  It had some interesting and enjoyable tastes but seemed a little dry for short rib as if it had been cooked hours prior, maybe even frozen and reheated for my meal - a suggestion that was strengthened by the fact a piece of tin foil was attached to the food.  The wine list has improved vastly over the 20 years we have been going to Duner's but don't expect to be served by anyone who knows much about the wine - even the pricier offerings.  Nonetheless, the wine was enjoyed by all as was the meal.  We'll try again another day, but not a Sunday.",100.0,Duners,0.9759,Monday

My recent experience was the most disappointing 'Fine dining' experience I've ever had. To start, they have completely gutted the bold and broad menu. So many unique dishes have been removed that were a Duner's staple. We started with the fried oysters and they were fine, nothing spectacular but they were good. For my entree we had the halibut and the duck. The Halibut was so dry it was crumbling, the polenta did not taste fresh nor had much flavoring. The duck ($40) and compliments were a complete disappointment. The duck tasted boiled and to top it off it was smothered in a strawberry topping that tasted like jarred smuckers jam. The potatoes were boiled and un-seasoned. To end on a good note our server was fantastic, and has served me before. 

I don't enjoy writing poor reviews and frankly I only write them in hopes that it will provide insight for areas of improvement. However, with the money that was spent and the quality (or lack there of) that was delivered I won't be back.",78.0,Duners,0.974,Wednesday

I was having a hard time deciding between 5 or 6 dishes! The waiter brought yummy bread and butter and was so professional and nice, but gave a comfortable feel. They have plenty of beers, but only Stella on tap...classy and delicious. We chose shrimp egg rolls as an app, then meatloaf and pan seared ahi tuna as our mains. All was prepared perfectly and so good!! Then, we chose the triple chocolate cheesecake and candy cane ice cream sandwich for dessert - a perfect way to top off a splendid meal!

The menu is limited in that all the dishes are very similar (also the menu wasn't posted online until about 1/2 hour before the restaurant opened, even though it was pretty much the same menu for past week or more). There weren't any chicken dishes, and only one pasta dish. We opted not to order an appetizer as nothing appealed to us. It took 20 minutes before we were served our first drinks. Also, the seating was so uncomfortable!! Small ladder back chairs with no comfort at all. The atmosphere is a '50's building with homemade touches (which wouldn't be an issue if the food was great, but it was just meh). The staff were lovely and very attentive which is why we are giving two stars. Our meal took an hour apparently due to my pork chop needing time to cook. If we had had an appetizer we wouldn't have minded, but again, the selection wasn't appealing. My husband had a steak. Both my pork chop and his steak were exceedingly tough and his steak was full of gristle. My broccoli and his asparagus were cooked to death. The mashed potatoes were just so-so. Dessert was ok, but again, nothing lived up the legend that this establishment has. Also, the noise level was so loud that my husband and I could not hear one another speak and we were seated at a small table for two.

Anyways, the moment I realize that they have great tacos is when I went at breakfast. And had their tacos with GARLIC MASHED POTATOES in them. That honestly makes everything so great. Coupled with eggs and queso fresco among other ingredients, you really can't go wrong. Highly recommend any of the tacos with the mashed potatoes in them.

The chips & dip was also super disappointing. The guacamole tasted packaged and the queso was very bland and had a weird film on it.

The Guisada was also really good. It had stewed brisket, jalapeños, and white onion. The brisket was incredibly soft and savory. As for the Carnitas, I thought it was just okay. It was kind of dry in my opinion and the flavors didn't stand out as much as the other tacos I tried that day.

I would recommend getting three tacos for a good sized meal. My favorites are the Pork Star (pork belly that has just the perfect amount of fattiness, paired with a refreshing watermelon pickle and must-have avocado) and Fish Aficionado (blackened tilapia with classic red turnip slices). 

Their drink menu is innovative (jalapeño margarita, anyone?), refreshing, and packed with flavor. Their guacamole is solid, and their salsas complement chips, tacos...everything nicely.

131,2018-04-11,5.0,"By far the best taco restaurant in the area! 

I've been to Brazos multiple times with friends, and I have always had a great experience. It is located right next to the IX Art Park, so the environment is enjoyable from the moment you pull into the parking lot.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating and fast service (even when there is a long line, they typically move quickly through the orders).

My favorite item on the menu is the Pork Star! It comes with a thick slice of pork belly, fresh avocado, sweet white onion, and cilantro. It has a great balance of flavors and textures, and it's a filling portion size. Typically a good portion is an order of about 3 tacos, and I always make sure the Pork Star is one of them!

Another favorite is a special that I always get when it's available. The steak, chimichurri, and mashed potato taco is delicious and filling. I've never had a taco quite like it, as it seems like a small serving of an entree from a high-end restaurant, resting on a fluffy tortilla.  

Brazo's is a fantastic place for a meal or even a quick snack, and I would highly recommend making a visit!",38.0,Brazos,0.9947,Wednesday

It's located in the IX Art Park and has a really great vibe, especially on days when it's sunny outside. 

I would caution that the wait is usually long during peak hours, so I often try to go at off-times. But I sometimes don't mind waiting in the line when I'm craving the tacos because they're just so good.

They allow you to choose between corn and flour tortillas, and I usually end up order 3 (4, if I'm hungry). Some of my favorites are: Carne Asada, Pork Star, Shady Grady, Sir Paul, and Shady Grady. 

They have a good (not a lot) of vegetarian options, but probably only a few vegan options unless you ask them to hold off on ingredients. They also have a selection of beer and drinks, and you can order chips & salsa while waiting for the tacos to be prepared!",31.0,Brazos,0.9843,Thursday

Brazos is your typical taco stand, with a decent selection of different toppings and combibstions, each with their own merits. 

I thought the texture of the tacos weren't great for the meat tacos. It felt really empty, the tortilla was much drier than the ingredients inside, and overall it didn't feel accessible to the mouth. Carne asada was also a big disappointment, which was a bummer.

The pork belly was nice, although the accompanying parts didn't do much to help.

One thing I really liked was the triple pickle. And I'd say  overall, the vegetarian tacos had more character, flavor, and texture to them. I'd definitely want to try more of those if given the chance.",595.0,Brazos,0.6131,Wednesday

For the indecisive ones:
There is a taco randomizer machine (Taco-bot) to help you with that. You can do give preferences or for the bold daredevils out there, you can do the random button. Makes it more enjoyable especially if you can't decipher from all the goodies.

Both of which were served cold and were fairly bland. The bacon was also forgotten from my potato egg and cheese taco which again is not unexpected since it was both loud and busy inside.

The guac was fresh but definitely needs some onions, cilantro, etc.

I got the fish aficionado taco and the solid taco. Two was definitely enough to fill me up since we got the chips. The fish taco was good and the solid taco was overpowered by the beans, I could barely taste the chicken.

There is ample parking, oh and in good weather they encourage dogs to hang out on the picnic benches outside. 

Triple pickle and many of their breakfast tacos are yummy! Their salsa bar reminds me of the places I used to go while living in San Diego (and their salsas taste good too!).

The only complaints I have are:
1. Their margaritas are super sweet, too sweet for me which is a problem when I want to have more than one.

I ended up liking the flour taco more so than the corn , since I found it to be a bit dry. I will say that in general I thought the tacos were just a bit too dry for me, but I'm no expert.

I ordered the suggested three tacos (if hungry). The carne asada tacos were delicious and fish taco was pretty tasty as well. My main problem was that I left hungry. I might have ordered another taco or two but they were already closed and that would have put my bill for food over 20 dollars. I had to go to Three Notch'd and get some sliders.

My wife and I are both Texas natives and Brazos is (proudly) deliberately striving to emulate Texan taquerias such as Torchys, Fuzzys, etc. Like most Texas taco joints, you go in and order at the front and take a number to your table.  They offer three sauces (red, green, and avocado) to top your tacos. While ordering you have a huge menu above your head to help you decide which tacos to get. We ordered the chip salsa, queso, and guacamole sampler (the whole shebang). For tacos I got the Austin Morning egg taco and the black bean and egg El Guapo taco. Both tacos were excellent and definitely reminded me of home. The Austin morning was the better taco of the two. My wife also got the El guapo and the tres queso. 

Some additional thoughts, the food comes out super fast. Our tacos came out before our chips but the chips came out only a few minutes later. The chip app. The portion size of the chips is massive. Way bigger than needed for two people. Would easily feed three. The salsa, queso and guacamole are mostly fine but won't blow anyone away. The queso was a little plain. One other minor gripe (via my wife), is the soda machine was completely out of diet drinks and the guy at front didn't tell her that when she ordered it. 

They also offer alcoholic beverages which is nice if you are in the mood or want to chill on their nice covered patio. Ultimately, I would def recommend Brazos tacos for anyone with that itch for a solid, filling taco.",526.0,Brazos,0.9825,Saturday

There are MANY options and during the week they do run specials like happy hour or half off during certain times of day. No matter what you choose you will enjoy. I know I always do.

I got three tacos- the Shady Grady, which has brisket and sweet potato inside, the pork carnitas, and the Tres Quesos, which is a vegetarian taco. Don't judge. All were excellent, but the best part was the pickled watermelon in the Tres Quesos.
Darling Bride got the Shady Grady, too, as well as The Solid (brisket and mashed potatoes), and a third one which I forgot to ask about because we were all so busy talking and eating. Cousin got a couple of tacos for herself and also an order of chips, salsa, and guacamole for the table. The salsa was a little thin but quite tasty, and these people really know their way around an avocado!

Zero service. Take out only. Clean your own table outside. No bathroom use.  You get the idea.   The only problem is that the Yelp reviews didn't reflect that so I need to leave this one because we chose Brazos based on Yelp. 

My husband and I stopped here on a road trip with our dogs.  We were looking forward to a nice lunch outside with table service and a bathroom.

The Philly-style taco had amazing flavor, inspired by ""philly cheesesteak"". The pork star was delicious, featuring amazing pork belly meat with a little bit of a spicy kick. 
Highly recommend this as a Charlottesville must-visit!!!",1201.0,Brazos,0.9924,Wednesday

Pretty decent tacos: Philly-Style, Triple Pickle, Chimichurri Steak and Potatoes.

Disappointing tacos: Pollo Rostizado (chicken was boiled like it belonged in a grocery store chicken soup), The Bill (overly sweet), Picadillo (meat tasted cheap).",109.0,Brazos,0.872,Friday

My online order was ready quickly and was brought to me curbside; they had designated parking spaces for this adjacent to a brewery with a lot of outdoor seating, but I drove elsewhere.

I came because of the large vegetarian variety in their tacos, and got three different ones. Some interesting ingredients emerged, including toasted sunflower seeds. The tortillas and beans and cheese were pretty standard, and this wasn't the height of taco artistry that I've ever seen, but I was certainly satisfied.

182,2022-04-06,4.0,"Brazos Tacos in Charlottesville, VA (near IX Art Park) is a classic! It's perfect for vegetarians due to their large variety of tacos and ability to accommodate any modifications. However, no matter the taco, Brazos never fails to satisfy!

My favorite breakfast tacos are the I Willie Love You and Migas Taco. The I Willie Love You is made with scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes, sliced avocado, roasted corn pico, and queso fresco. The Migas Taco is egg filled with tomatoes, onions, peppers, tortilla chips, and jack cheese. Both are served on tortilla of your choice.

My favorite go-to tacos are the Triple Pickle, Nacho Taco, and Sir Paul. The Triple Pickle is refried black beans, mushroom bruja, roasted pepitas, jalapeños, red onion pickles, jalapeño pickles, and pickled watermelon with lime. Trust me, I know its sounds weird, but IT IS SO GOOD! The Nacho Taco is more basic with beans, pickled jalapeños, onions, tomatoes, corn chips, and house queso. The Sir Paul is a simpler creation that's made with refried black beans, avocado, roasted corn pico, and roasted pepitas. 

Honorable mentions go to the This Is My Yam and Tres Quesos. This Is My Yam is a must try with its crisped sweet potatoes, refried black beans, sliced avocado, queso fresco, and roasted pepitas. Finally the Tres Quesos is a classic with its oaxacan cheese, manchego cheese, queso fresco, refried black beans, sliced avocado, roasted corn pico, and pickled watermelon.

225,2023-12-07,4.0,"Our first visit to this restaurant -- for a late lunch on a Wednesday in Dec around 2 pm.  We were greeted and seated quickly by the hostess.  The restaurant was quiet, with patrons at only two or three other tables.  We noticed that they also had a nice fenced-in outdoor seating area but it was closed given the cold temperatures. 

Most of the menu was Mexican street-style tacos with interesting choices for fillings, served on your choice of a small (6""? diameter) tortilla (corn, flour, or in a cup).  The menu suggested ordering 3 tacos if you're hungry; the waitress said many choose two tacos for lunch or three for dinner. 

We each ordered two tacos.  My husband preferred his choice from the vegetarian menu -- This Is My Yam ($4.00, his rating 5/5). This featured crisped yams with black beans, avocado, queso fresco, and roasted pepitas.  He also got a Carnitas taco ($4.25, 3/5), with slow-roasted pork shoulder, avocado, pickled red onion, cilantro, and lime.  He would've preferred shredded pork to the chunks served in the taco, and less pickled red onion.  My preferred taco was my Guisada ($4.75, rating 4/5), which featured slow-roasted brisket, diced onion, pickled jalapeño, and queso fresco. My second choice was the vegan The Woody ($4.20, 3/5), which had black beans, mushrooms in salsa bruja, roasted corn pico, and avocado. While I like all of the individual ingredients, it seemed to be missing something when put together. 

The restaurant also offered four salsas (two spicy) at a do-it-yourself counter. We took samples of all, but the tacos were flavorful enough without the added sauces. We would've liked if the tacos were served with an included side dish -- though a few options were offered on the menu, such as escabeche ($5), slaw ($4), or wood-grilled broccolini ($7).  The restaurant also offers some interesting drinks including aqua frescas and margaritas that we didn't try, this time.

The best out out of the three was the carne asada, which thankfully was not dry. The carnitas was just okay. The fish aficionado was not good, too dry and not much flavor, which was really a miss for me.

It's located near this really charming art park. I loved the complex. There were other local businesses in the area as well as ample parking spots. There was plenty of seating options both indoors and outdoors.

You order at the front and get a number to sit wherever. We both loved how there were tons of vegetarian options that sounded really good. I ordered the this is my yam and carnitas taco on corn tortilla. They were both really delicious. My friend loved her two tacos (she also got the yam one and a different one).

I loved the coloring sheets and mugs filled with crayons near the front. There was also tons of natural lighting. The person at the cashier was really kind and helpful with the menu.

FOOD 2/5
Not really even average, the food here tastes as cheap and quick as it is made. The low quality ingredients and mish-mash of premade items reminds me of a grade school cafeteria. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, it just doesn't really taste good. About one step up from a frozen Mexican TV dinner. 

DRINK 3/5
The restaurant shines in its ability to provide cheap alcohol. Not the greatest margaritas in the world by a long shot, but you can get a lot of them and have a good time.

AMBIENCE 3/5
There are a couple locations in Charlottesville, this one isn't the greatest but it isn't bad. About a dozen tables with nice warm colored walls. The big sell here is the limited amount of outdoor seating which makes this a very nice place in warmer weather.

The food is always delicious. Often my husband and I can share something plus maybe a side each and be nice and full, so it is quite an affordable option. I love getting something off of their specialties part of the menu, but I have to admit it takes me forever to look through the super long menu options.

One thing I don't love is that it feels cramped in this location. The other Guad locations have a lot more room, but this one is conveniently close to downtown which may be why there is less space. The bathrooms are super small and cramped as well. However, that doesn't take away from the good food and great service! It just means you may have a wait or just a cramped space to sit and move around.

The Shrimp Cocktail served in a large margarita glass was loaded with shrimp, avocado, cilantro and jalapenos in a light tomato based sauce... so good!

During this time, another table had been sat down ( about 10 minutes after us) , they had received their drinks, AND ordered their food, AND then they RECEIVED their food soon after we had just ORDERED ours. 

By the time we actually got our food, the other table was long gone. Unfortunately, we had to wait another 20 minutes before we actually got our checks after our food had been cleared.  Frankly I was disappointed with the service because my roommate had experienced something similar but I had hoped it was just a fluke in service that day.

After ordering delivery recently, however, I was much happier with the food we got and want to give them a shout out during these hard times of food delivery!

We got the nachos texanos which was reminiscent of Tex-Mex vibes with its grilled fajita style chicken, steak, and shrimp topped with onions and bell pepper. The shrimp and steak were super tasty, but was a little masked by the liquid cheese sauce (bias note: I prefer melted shredded cheese on nachos). It felt pricey at $18, but the portion was huge!!

The floors are another issue--not only sticky but also slippery like they haven't been properly cleaned in a while.

Overall, it's the service that has been so terrible. Waiting forever to place an order, to receive the bill, and even just to get basic attention from staff has become the norm.

Tom Yum soup- great flavor, chicken was tender, a little spicy but it was to add a little kick which I enjoyed (normally don't enjoy spicy).

Pad Thai- delicious, great amount of sauce of it and cooked really well, peanut taste wasn't too strong which I appreciated. This tied for favorite dish with the one below.

Pad See Eaw- sooo yummy, noodles were a great texture and capture all the sauce, highly recommend.

Ka Pow- got it with beef and it was my friends favorite part of the meal (we shared it all), spicy but can still taste all the different flavors. I could very clearly taste the basil so stay away if you aren't a fan.",396.0,Monsoon,0.996,Friday

(This was my first time there) 

The waitress I had was vegetarian and actually super helpful in regards to vegan options. She said right up front that they could make pretty much anything without fish sauce. When I asked for the spice tray she showed me which was fish sauce so I'd know. 


As far as the actual food, I love love loved my fresh rolls and I got ""pad cashew nut"" which came with rice. Absolutely delicious and the spices on the spice tray were the best I've had. 

Great portion size in my opinion. 

One negative was that the fryer was broken so we couldn't have any fried tofu or spring rolls or anything. Hopefully this was just a fluke and they get it fixed soon. I didn't knock them down a star for it because sometimes unforseeable things happen.

The place itself is super cute; I really loved the hanging lights and atmosphere. It was pretty popping for a Sunday night (when we came) but service was great the whole night. Even when we messed up on how to split the check the servers were really patient and kind (forgive us!). 

The food itself was super solid! I got a beef pad see ew and really loved the flavor. The noodles were just the right texture and the beef wasn't too fatty. Will say that I didn't really enjoy the mostly stems that were used instead of actual broccoli flowers, but everything else was tasty.

Ordered spring rolls, they were okay. Very crispy so 1/4 of the shell breaks off when you go to eat them.

Would have preferred duck sauce over the sweet and sour sauce they used.

Was in the mood for fried rice, did a chicken and beef chicken fried rice. Charged for full beef, even though I didn't receive ""double meat"" portions. Not a big deal but when your bill is $35 for 2 basic entrees & 4 spring rolls sort of makes you wonder.

The fried rice was not bad, it was very bland. Gordon Ramsey would say that chef mike made it, you know.. the microwave.

I don't actually think they microwave their food, just that the fried rice was bland.

Outdoor seats give you a perch over the Market street climb toward 2nd street. Metal patio seats of a harder bench, bossa nova, and melody gardot in the background. An empty patio quickly filled on a Tuesday night with smiling diners.

The thai food was good. We planned to stray from the curries, but the waiter, when asked, insisted twice the curries were fresh made.   Green and red curries were flavorful.  Maybe not top notch all times, but among top rank in charlottesville.  Asked if I could 'tolerate spice' in the green curry, yea.  Hardly thai heat, more an american summer--If seeking ask for more.

It offers a widely varied menu of Asian specialties with unique twists and plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. The fresh rolls are my favorite things to order as an appetizer each time - they're stuffed with avocado that's fresh and creamy, and the peanut sauce it's served with is to DIE for. The first time I went, I ordered the rama tofu, which was smothered in the peanut sauce that I loved, but hard to eat with only the spoon I was provided with, and a bit pricey at $14. Next time I got a tofu and veggie sautee, which was delicious, yet quite a small portion for $10. 

The venue is also a positive. It has a beautiful outdoor dining area under string lights to enjoy in warm weather. The inside is clean and tasteful too, yet a big cramped and dark.

Curries are solid, though a little soupier than other Thai restaurants I've been to. I have also tried their Kao Soi with soft shelled crab. The crab was great and the dish looked really cool, but I felt like all the dry noodles on top were a little distracting from the egg noodles in the soup that I wanted to get to!

Everything about this dish has been consistent each time I've ordered it. A couple other dishes to comment on: their drunk noodles were too salty and greasy for my liking, their papaya salad also too salty, kinda lacked sweetness. I usually get their food thai hot, but end up adding more red pepper to my dish. 

A couple problems I've run into: parking - I wish it was more ample, and their lack of response phone calls. I've almost given up on take out because they don't answer their phones. Although I will say, I've never had a problem with service when I dine in.

Food: I got the massaman curry and it was very good. The chicken was super tender and the flavor of the curry was amazing. Only suggestion-have them chop up the peanuts and sprinkle on top instead of leaving them whole. My husbands Pad Thai was good too but we agreed the curry was better. We had the mango sticky rice for desert and that was on par for the best mango sticky rice I have had. 

Wait time: We sat down at 6 and it wasn't very crowded, however, by 7, every outdoor table was taken!

Now for the food. Let me start with 10/10! The Ka Pow was such a good spice! Had a kick but still good enough to eat and enjoy. My partner got the Pad Thai and he loved it too.

I'd heard really good things about the food here and came with a group of friends. Sadly, the experience that I had here was firmly below mid. The food took 30+ minutes to come out, and it wasn't that they forgot about us - people around us were also not getting their food either. This place is either understaffed or the logistics need some work. 

With regards to the food itself, it was good but not great. My duck noodles came in a sauce that was supposed to be a little spicy (it wasn't). The duck itself was seasoned well and quite tasty, but the noodles were okay. We were all very hungry by the time we got our food, which probably made the food taste better than it was.

When we got our bill, we realized that they had built in a mandatory 20% tip, which is particularly annoying as we had received such bad service.

The building was small. Not a lot of room for a breakdance battle, but I don't mind at all because it was beautiful and it let me be even closer to my co-reviewer Charlotte!

All the other dishes were alright in my opinion, so would definitely come here for the Drunken Noodles. Great service and will satisfy your Thai craving at UVA.

I was visiting C-ville with my extended family just for half a day and I chose this place over so many good lunch options, and Monsoon Siam delivered like ... a monsoon rain of flavors! (See what I did there?) 
First, it's a bit off the Main Street so you might be tempted to not go there... but Main Street means more price for not always better quality... so check one box. And it did not disappoint my large group of family - almost every dish we ordered was tasty in that authentic Thai way and service was also prompt. 
We had kids from toddler to teen ages and they all went silent eating, and all the adults were sharing and enjoying. 
Just to highlight a few, my Hai Yat noodle was absolutely delicious... perfect chewy noodles in savory sauce with tons of fresh delicious seafood. Other winners were pad kee mao (drunken noodle), pad Thai, and crab fried rice.
One minor mistake was when we didn't get the Kao Soi noodle dish because there was misunderstanding and they brought another dish instead which was gingery... but even that, we finished it all so wasn't a big deal. Their Thai iced tea was a tad bit too sweet though. 
Everybody left with a fully belly and we even took a group pic to commemorate our lunch. 
Definitely stop by for some authentic Thai flavor monsoon. You won't be disappointed - coming from someone who was in Bangkok just few months ago.",460.0,Monsoon,0.9899,Saturday

459,2025-01-02,5.0,"My best friend and I were ranking cuisines after we ate here and we both agreed that Thai was probably in top 5 -- not sure if Monsoon Siam ended up skewing it because honestly it was that good. We got the hat yay noodle, crispy pork noodle, and fresh rolls.

The peanut sauce that goes with the fresh rolls is borderline drinkable and honestly good enough of a reason to order it to begin with. I absolutely love how crunchy and fresh the vegetables are and it's so well-balanced with the creaminess of the avocado.

The crispy texture of the coating on the pork paired really well with the softness of the noodles, and the presentation was immaculate, although the meat tasted a little bit gamey. 

But I think the real star of the show was the hat yay noodles. It was so sweet and savory at the same time, perfectly saucy, and the chewy noodles provided such a great comparison to the crunchy veggies and the outer fried rice paper! The seafood was also a really nice touch.

The interior is super duper cute and I would love to come back on a day trip to try out more of the dishes they have.",136.0,Monsoon,0.9965,Thursday

461,2015-05-06,4.0,"Maybe it was the twinkling lights or the exposed brick walls or perhaps the garage door windows but I felt a welcoming warmth rush over me as soon as I walked in.

The menu was explained as small plates but most definitely NOT tapas because they were served as they came out from the kitchen and not all at once. This concept was definitely lost on me since I'm pretty sure that is exactly what tapas is...but I digress....

Everything on the menu looked absolutely fantastic so whittling down our choices was quite hard. We decided to go with (almost) ALL of the things!

Roasted beets with ricotta cheese - Nature has never tasted this good before
Roasted brussel sprouts - I'm a huge fan of brussel sprouts but I thought this was okay. The sprouts should have been roasted a bit longer to caramelize and get tender and this strongly tasted of fish sauce without any other flavor.
Scallop Crudo - A generous portion of the most tender, sweet scallops I have ever tasted. It took every bit of will in my body not to snatch all of these at once.
Grilled octopus open faced sando - The garbanzo puree on the toast was simple and delicious. I'm definitely going to be incorporating this into my sandwiches at home. That being said, the octupus was overcooked and rubbery and tasted like char. 
S'mores Bread Pudding - The most inventive bread pudding I've ever seen. I loved how all the slices tasted like brownie ends and the bruleed marshmallow was just perfection.",2041.0,Oakhart,0.9976,Wednesday

Overall Experiene: 4.0/5.0

TL;DR: order the shaved salad, wood fired oysters, sweet sticky pork belly and pork shank. Could get better food else where for the price but the atmosphere and customer service made this place worthwhile. Not sure I would ever come back here though.

For those beer & wine lovers: there's an extensive menu and seasonal specials. 

We ordered the following:

Shaved salad: It always seems a little silly to me to go out and order a salad, but you can't go wrong with this salad! There's so much flavor to this salad and the combination of items was brilliant. There was a lot of dressing on the salad and I absolutely hate salad dressing but everything for this dish worked. Highly recommend this item!

Wood fired oysters: Definitely do not like oysters because of the taste and texture. But Oakhart made this work in every single way! The flavor was light and not very ""oyster"" like and there was a brilliant crunch from the crumb. This order comes with four oysters, so make sure you order according to your party size. 

Oyster Mushrooms: Mehhh. There wasn't anything particularly special about the flavor of this item for me.

Provoletta: If I did my visit over, I would definitely pass on this item. The bread for the make your own ""pizza"" is a bit too wood fired cooked for me. In addition, the bread had a lot of holes when it was baked, so there wasn't a lot of a bread filling. The provolone and goat cheese combination wasn't my favorite. 

Chicken wangz: Would not really recommend this item. The cream sauce was the same one served with the shaved salad but it did not go well with the wings to me.

Sweet & Sticky pork belly: Solid order but this wasn't the best pork belly I've ever had or something that really stands out to me. Definitely a good amount of flavor and would recommend but is not something special.

Chili lime roast shrimp pizza: My friends and I agree that this pizza tastes like any regular pizza but the difference for Oakhart social is how well the pizza was cooked. You can taste the smokiness of the pizza and the crust was fluffy yet soft. The texture and consistency were good but the flavors of the pizza was just whatever. 

Pork Shank Special: The pork fell off nicely and was cooked super well. It was delicious but I was kind of confused with the pairing of items. The pork shank was served on a pile of some sort of grains that I can't recall what it was?  There was also a yogurt cilantro to pair with the pork and I wished they stopped there. The combination of the Indian taste like grains and American meat was odd but would have been yummier without the grains. Still a solid order though!

Overall: The rustic atmosphere of brick wall, dimly lit light and excellent service made dinner very pleasant! Unfortunately, I'm not sure Oakhart Social is a place I would come to again but it was definitely a fun experience. My biggest beef with this place is probably the pairing of items - the combination just didn't work for me. There's an outside eating area that would be nice for when the weather is warmer.",56.0,Oakhart,0.9951,Thursday
463,2017-02-10,4.0,"My friend and I came here for dinner and ordered the Brussels Sprouts (with Korean chilli, aioli, and crispy shallots) and the Marinated Mushrooms & Black Kale Pizza (with garlic potato cream and parmesan). 

The pizza was one of the best I've ever had! The garlic potato cream was an amazing touch. The brussels sprouts were a little disappointing though, as they were very salty. I've seen other great reviews for the brussels sprouts so I think it was just an off-night for them, but I'd recommend ordering the aioli on the side just in case. The crispy shallots on top almost made up for the saltiness though.

Service was good and they have a private parking lot right next to it! That was a major plus for me, especially since it's so hard to find street parking in the West Main area.

Also, the menu they have on their website is not completely accurate. There were a few dishes that didn't appear on the menu in the actual restaurant, but there were still plenty of delicious options.",619.0,Oakhart,0.9654,Friday
464,2017-03-05,5.0,"Dang, I like this place. 

Built out of an old three stall auto shop, this restaurant/bar doesn't try to hide it's history. I believe the original renovation was completed by a restaurant that failed. Oakhart took over and while I'm not sure on what they changed, the end results are great. The two stalls on the left still have their garage doors, but replaced with French doors connecting their dining patio. The patio makes the best of its space and stretches across all three stalls. It is lit with overhead hung oversized bulb lighting, which gives it a nice ambiance. The bar takes the space of the stall on the far right. About ten seats at the L shaped bar.

I've sat at the bar every time I've been here and it has suited me just fine. They do encourage drinking here, so if that's on your list, you'll fit right in. They have quite a large wine selection. I just tried to ignore that page of the menu!

The brussel sprouts were an awesome appetizer. I also enjoyed the crispy lamb shank tremendously. It was served on a bed of sunflower hummus, which I had to cut back on trying to stretch it with my lamb. I also tried other dishes and was not disappointed.",162.0,Oakhart,0.9837,Sunday

466,2017-10-03,3.0,"I came here on a weeknight after a long day of classes and was ready to feast. I heard so many good things about this establishment and have driven by several times telling myself that I needed to try the place out. The place looks so promising with their cute decor and natural lighting, but it just didn't deliver to the hype. 

I tried the mushroom grits, octopus oyster mushroom pizza, and the margherita pizza. The mushroom grits were...interesting. The grits were actually quite tasty and creamy; however the mushroom was kind of weird. It was larger, tart, and had a bitter char on it. I wasn't the biggest fan. It came with garbanzo beans that were yummy, but the whole dish had this interesting Indian flavor. For 13 dollars tho, I really don't think it was worth it. Our server recommended the octopus mushroom pizza and since it sounded different we decided to go for it. The pizza had  a good thin crust, but it was actually quite burnt so there was a slight bitter taste in each bite. Ironically, it got soggy quickly even though it was burnt. Thank god for the margherita pizza. It honestly saved the meal. It was actually so delicious and was a decent size. The basil on it was so fresh and everything was perfect. 

The biggest disappointment about this place was how everything was served ONE AT A TIME. I get it but man they really could not work with us because we were starving. They waited for us to finish each plate before presenting us with the next one. The problem was we didn't intend on sharing our plates like a tapas style meal so it was pretty annoying. I really don't think I would come back...idk maybe for drinks. Overall, I wouldn't give this place more than 3 stars just because it was pricey, the food wasn't that great, and the portions were wayyy too small.",196.0,Oakhart,0.9828,Tuesday

First off, I loved the interior design and ambiance. The lighting is warm and cozy and the tables are well arranged to maximize numbers yet provide enough intimacy. The bar is not big but there's a little ""socializing area"" between the dining area and the bar where people gather and chat. I thought that was a cute design! The restaurant does get a little loud so sometimes it can get hard to hold a conversation. 

For the meal, they started us off with complimentary champagne- a nice surprise for the night. The plates are meant to be shared so they serve the dishes as soon as they come out. My boyfriend and I got the shaved salad, the hanger steak, and the ribs. 

The shaved salad was beyond amazing. I don't even know all the different vegetables and fruits they put in there, but the combination was magical. The crumbs on the top combined with the sauce give the salad such a nice crunch as well as a rich, tangy taste. Most highly recommend! 

My next favorite dish was the onion ring and ribs. The BBQ sauce and aioli sauce were so delicious! The ribs were well smoked and very meaty. The portion size was also quite large, definitely enough for two. 

The hanger steak was good, too, but did not quite match up to my expectations. It was definitely too well done and too tough for a ""medium,"" and it took a long time before we got it. The potatoes that accompanied the dish were fabulous though- crispy and well-seasoned!

469,2018-03-16,4.0,"This place is very good! The best way to do it is to go with a group and share so you can sample lots of different dishes. My favorite items thus far have been the shaved salad, ricotta toast, squash tortellini, and bread pudding. I am generally anti-salad so the fact that the shaved salad made it into my top dishes list shows just how good it is. 

A lot of people love the brussels sprouts here too but both times I've had them they were a bit undercooked. The catfish was prepared well but wasn't ""Nashville Hot"" as advertised. 

Overall, the quality of food here is quite high. The main reason I don't want to give 5 stars is because their cocktail menu is lacking-- it's all gins and whiskeys. I don't know why it is so hard to find good tequila cocktails in Cville! They also make you put in a credit card if you are reserving a table online, which is kind of a bummer.

The biggest take-a-way I got was that this place offers a tapas style dining experience and if you aren't going to eat your meal tapas style, you probably won't enjoy it. I ate at this restaurant a while ago and everyone at my table got their own entree (no sharing at all) so we all did not have a great experience. However, when I came here recently and had a tapas style meal, it was an amazing experience! 

The server recommended everyone at the table getting 2-3 dishes to share. Sharing was a great way to try all the small dishes at this restaurant. Here are a few items we got:
-Shaved Salad: This sounded just like an ordinary salad but it was so good. Definitely one of the best salads I've ever had. Get this! 
-Wood Fire Oysters: I loved the citrus gremolata on the oysters. Also, the bacon fat really tied this dish together. 
-Roasted Beets: I'm not a big fan of beets so this dish wasn't that great for me. The beets tasted pretty bland- just boiled beets basically.
-Pate: Surprisingly, the pate was really good on the toasted, crunchy bread that it came with. I usually don't eat or like pate but it was pretty good.
-Grilled Octopus: I really liked the octopus! It had a charred flavor and the texture was nice.
-Chicken Wangz: GET THIS. I loved this dish. The chicken wings are so savory, crunchy, and just perfect. 
-Hanger Steak: The steak was super tender and flavorful. I loved the fried potatoes that came with this dish. 
-Fried Catfish: This was also one of my favorites of the meal. The catfish was moist and the breading was so crunchy. 
-Five Cheese Garlic Pizza: Very creamy and really crispy! 
-Pot de Creme: A solid dessert. The creme was smooth and indulgent.

The crispy lamb shank is probably the best dish of the restaurant, with the meat cooked perfectly well -- super juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I think the process of cooking the dish takes a while, so they limit to ordering it until 9:30 PM.

Eloquent Bastard: this smelled like soap or some kind of detergent. I had to hold my breath to drink it and it was far from good. Half of the drink was foam. 

Pineapple 22A: this tasted like straight liquor mixed with burnt pineapple juice. 


For food we got:

Beets: This was nothing special. It tasted like beets from a can. 

Squash: This was the best part of our meal and that's saying a lot. Again, nothing special. 

Octopus: Half of the octopus was burnt and completely inedible. 

Swordfish: This tasted like something you would get from the frozen aisle of the grocery store. The fish had no flavor and it was very dry. The accompanying sauce tasted like a cheap honey mustard. The garnish was pieces of bitter lettuce.

My wife and I are farmers and don't get out much. But somehow, the three or four times we've come here, a new and impeccably-dressed gay man has complimented my wife's outfit. I'd been previously unaware that the fashion opinions of said men carry enough weight with cishet women to inhale the light of a collapsing star, but damned if I didn't learn something new that first time. 

She was a happy lady after leaving Oakhart Social. We didn't have any children the first time we went, and now we have two. I'll leave it to your imagination/nightmares to put two and two together.

What we ordered: pizza (it was actually good), carrots (surprisingly tasty and filling), hanger steak (horrible it tasted like liver), pork and pineapple (good), and the s'mores for dessert  (good). 

What really made them get the lower score was the steak was horrible, and the service was even worse. I have never felt so unwelcomed in a space that I was paying to be in.

First, the ambiance is pretty great.  I like the painted brick.  Decor is nicely done.  

The food is meant to be shared.

Started with the shaved salad.  This vegetarian option was fresh and light.  The dressing was a perfect match to the vegetables.

Next up were the charred carrots which were charred to perfection - is that possible?  

Moving on to the artic char.  The braised cabbage made for an interesting dish.  Really liked this one.

The sausage pizza was delicious.   The crust thin.  The peppers with just enough sweetness.  

For dessert, the pot du creme hit the spot.

Our whole party was pleased.   Great spot in C'Ville.",500.0,Oakhart,0.9975,Sunday

The place is small plates-ish style - so you can def order to share.  If you only order one thing ORDER THE RICOTTA TOAST.  It is DELIGHTFUL!  The bread is that thick cut bougie fresh toast with that oh so creamy goodness of ricotta lathered on top.  It's then served with peas on top and a light and amazing vinaigrette. YES. It's a win. You won't regret it. I promise.

The other dish that stood out to me as well was the mushroom pizza.  Amazing cheesy goodness!   Plus, got to love the fungi!  The pork steak is also quite an impressive plate - so not for the faint of heart.  Ok, but not-so-faves, stood the scallion pancake and the wood-fired oysters... 
If you come by during happy hour, there are a few food specials and the fired mushrooms are also quite delicious.

The beverages are also good to the last drop - carefully crafted they are so well thought out and truly different.  I was a big fan of the perfect perfect manhattan as well as the mezcal pineapple beauty that was recipe number 22A version of the cocktail.

It was odd to me though that when we walked in there were a TON of empty seats in the main dining room which apparently were being saved for others who had made reservations beforehand, funny enough even after our full meal, those tables were still empty, oh well.

The bartender was super friendly and gave us many recommendations for different things to eat and drink.  We tried the house sausage pizza which honestly was just so-so at best.

I loved the crispy parmesan crumbles and salad dressing, which was creamy but tasted light. The Oyster Mushroom was so delightful we practically licked the plate clean. The Grilled Pork Steak gifted an explosion of flavors thanks to the pineapple, jalepeno, and peanut topping. My friend and I were in disbelief as we happily savored each bite. 

We were too full to properly enjoy dessert, but the chocolate was just sweet enough and not at all overpowering. Overall, a terrific experience! Worth the substantial bill.

You run 5k to not feel bad about the dessert you ate. You order vegetables so that the pizza doesn't seem as bad shared. When I travel for work, I always look for a new spot to try and get inspired. I'm Charlottesville, I was taken to Oakhart Social @oakhartsocial; it felt like I was walking right into a local Brooklyn spot. To paint the picture the walls were full of brick, painted white, and the floors of reclaimed wood. A bit dim in the space, there was a coziness in the air.

Our Picks:
Charred Carrots
Shaved Salad
Pepperoni Pizza
Pork Steak
Squash

There is no doubt in my mind that I would come back. The food was delish (small plates meant to be shared), service great and a great fusion of flavors.

And the  margherita PIZZA. So good. The crust itself has so much flavor. They are really tasting everything to make sure their salt level is perfect. The pizza had a nice char in certain spots.

I also like the crunch topping on it.  We also ordered the mushroom pizza which was better than I expected.  The creaminess of the ricotta mixed with the pesto and oyster mushrooms made for a really nice blend of flavors.

The shaved salad was light, complex, super tasty, and unlike any salad I've ever had (in a good way!). I highly recommend it. The brussels and pancake were delicious, and surprisingly filling for a veggie dish, and the fried chicken portion was also deceivingly big. We both left dinner very stuffed, and very happy.

He also gave great advice on drink choices, steering me towards the spring spritz, which was a delightful cocktail and, as he said, ""a lot of fun.""

The shaved salad received high praise online and I knew I had to have it. I love salads, and this didn't let me down. Peeled carrots and thin slices of apple and breadcrumbs(!!!) coming together with lightly dressed arugula was so texturally impressive, not to mention how well the flavors worked. I could eat the salad as a whole meal. The slivers of date brought such brightness. I kept trying to construct the ""perfect bite"" of salad with all the components, but every combination is its own treat.

I savored every bit of the tuna crudo. For me, the jalapeno was too much and overwhelmed my palate, so I only tried it with one piece. The citrusy sauce was so, so good, I was trying to sop up a good amount with every morsel of tuna. I want more.

Ramp is all the rage, so I chose the pappardelle dish over the xo carbonara which had also caught my eye. Again, a feat of flavors. Each noodle was perfectly coated in butter, and the pickled ramp were little bursts of joy. The oyster mushrooms were cooked to have nice deep flavor, and again, the textural variety was excellent, I loved the bits of walnut. 

This was a perfect early dinner meal, allowing enough time for an early evening stroll afterwards and maybe finding room for dessert. I would not come here if I was so, so hungry, because I had such good food that I wanted to be able to appreciate every bite.",210.0,Oakhart,0.9975,Sunday

It evokes a city-like, hip atmosphere with quite some creative combination of flavors. To sample what the menu had to offer, we got a variety of dishes and shared together. 

Starting with the peach & shishito toast, we wished the toast was a bit crunchier to support the toppings. The pickled onions had a subdued flavor, which is something I prefer as it would overwhelm the milder sweetness of the peach. Although there was nothing glaringly wrong with this dish, it was the charred carrots appetizer that truly won us over. The crunchiness of the pecans paired nicely with the tenderness of the carrots. If carrots were to be overdone, the texture would be too soft. Yet this dish maintained the proper bite of a carrot while being tender. 

The fried chicken was a pleasant new rendition of a seemingly simplistic dish.  Containing a bit of Southeast Asian influence, the batter was crispy and maintained juiciness while the garnishes were an assortment of basil, mint, and cilantro. The lightness and freshness of the herbs provided a contrast to the fried chicken yet balanced in a remarkably appealing way. And while fish sauce is typically sharp and seemingly out of place with fried chicken, this rendition complemented surprisingly well. 

The trout was crispy and while the flavor profile wasn't awful, it lacked the spunk and impression that the other dishes provided. 

The desserts on the other hand fell flat and would recommend going somewhere else instead.",76.0,Oakhart,0.9919,Saturday

They have an outdoor tent that's heated and it looked like blankets at the table. But the tent was def warmer than inside which is where we sat. I feel like this place is a hidden gem and hardly gets suggested when asking people of good places to eat. I'm throwing Oakhart into my top 3 suggestions. We ordered several dishes and drinks. The espresso martini was prob one of the best I've found here in Cville. The hibiscus Margarita also very tasty. As for food.... We started with the shaved salad which was amazing, however it seemed over salted not sure if it was added, or the garlic parm dressing or what. It was a great mix in flavors, nice hint apples and dates. Next was the ricotta toast which was probably my favorite dish. I've been obsessing over pepper jelly lately and that was the perfect ingredient to add to this toast. The flavors balanced out so well with the ham, the jelly, the cheese, and the pear. 10/10 recommend that fish. We had the wood fire oysters which I didn't think anything special about them but my bfs absolutely loved them. Our main entree dishes I had ordered the grilled pork steak which was a perfect mix with sweet, spicy and nutty. The pineapple with the steak, and the jalapeños just OMG mouth watering good. The five cheese pizza was nothing special, my bf ordered which advised against, which we would have gotten the sausage pizza instead. Lastly we ordered dessert. The s'more bread pudding was mind blowing. I could have ordered like 4 more of those. The service was absolutely amazing, spot on with delivery of each dish one by one without long waits in between. They cleared dishes rather quickly too which I like when places do that. I def am coming back here sooner than later. 10/10 highly recommend.

This place is great for any occasion, including spilling scandalous secrets with your girlfriends or going on a first date with that guy you met from Hinge(and if that doesn't go well, at least the ABC store is right across the street). 


 Of course the food was absolutely exquisite. We started with the charred carrots, which were nicely topped off with some micro greens, sprouts to be exact(8/10). Then, we got the Hanger Steak(100/10), decorated with fingerling potatoes and chimichurri on both sides. The steak was tender and the potatoes were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Also, the dish came with this gochujang aeoli that I was practically scraping off with my fork even after I finished the food. For our last dish, we got the sausage pizza(9/10). The tomato sauce was so rich and paired well with the thin crust. With room for desserts, we got the Pear Fry Pie(8.5/10) and S'mores Bread Pudding(9/10), which were also great.

It's great for a date or girls night. I've tried most of the dishes here and they're amazing. The cocktails are great too. On my most recent visit with friends, I tried the espresso martini. It was good and I thought it tasted like La Colombe Vanilla Latte mixed with vodka.

My favorites dishes here are the Hanger Steak, Charred Carrots, and most recently the Roasted Broccoli. The hanger steak here is my favorite hanger steak ever. I'm glad they brought it back on my visits this past year. The charred carrots and roasted broccoli are my favorite carrots and broccoli that I've ever had. They are consistently prepared well and cooked to perfection. These dishes are must orders when I visit. The fish sauce caramel, garlic aioli, and sesame crumble for texture on the broccoli are divine.

The only dishes I haven't liked in my time coming here are the Tuna Crudo and Cabbage Scallion Pancakes.

The beet salad with oranges and yogurt and something crunchy was delicious. The seared trout was tender and sweet, and accompanied by small potatoes in something like a cilantro-honey sauce. All of the dishes featured a variety of flavors and spices. They had a variety of craft beers, but my only complaint is that they were served in cans, not on draft.

We arrived around 5:45-6pm on a Friday evening, without a reservation, and were told that there would be a wait, as it was starting to get busy. I would recommend a reservation because we waited about 30 minutes for an opening at the bar. The service was good, not great, but the staff were very friendly! The ambiance was rustic and the interior had an inviting feel about it. 

Their food is meant to be shared amongst the table and is portioned accordingly. We started with the shaved salad and beets. They were both unique dishes with nice combinations of flavors. The shaved salad had arugula, fennel, carrots, watermelon radish, fuji apples, medjool dates, crumb, and a garlic parmesan dressing. The shaved veggies were super crisp, the apples and dates added a slight sweetness, the crumbs gave it some texture, and the parmesan dressing tied all the flavors together. Overall it was a really unique, tasty slaw-like salad, would recommend! The beet dish included oranges, yogurt, pistachio, and tarragon. The beets were complimented by the oranges and the yogurt sauce gave it some tang. Next out pizzas arrived, and boy were they something! We tried the mushroom pizza first and were BLOWN away with it! The mushroom pizza has oyster and shiitake mushrooms, house-made ricotta, red sauce, and pistachio pesto. The pistachio pesto had immense flavor and paired magically with the creamy ricotta cheese. Next was the bacon pizza which had potato cream, bacon, kale, red onion, and lemon zest. This was definitely a different pizza, never had pizza with potato cream before. The potato cream had a richness to it, complimented by the smokiness of the bacon, and the slight citrus of the lemon. Overall both our pizzas were stellar and they weren't too heavy. We both agreed the  mushroom pizza was our favorite though. We ended the night with their s'mores bread pudding and certainly didn't regret it! We loved various elements of this dessert including the torched marshmallows and puppy chow. The bread pudding was a nice size and was warm when it arrived. 

All in all, we had a lovely experience here at Oakhart Social. The food was full of bold flavors, made with fresh, high quality ingredients. The service was decent, but could have been a little better. My mom ordered a coffee, which they forgot, so they took a drink off our bill. Everything we ordered we thoroughly enjoyed.

After seeing how delicious the dinners of those around me looked, I went out on a limb and ordered a dish with spinach (I normally despise it) and I ended up polishing it off.

I went in the winter time so it was a bit cramped inside.  I can definitely see the potential for it in the warmer months though.

-1 star for the fact that our waitress broke the cork while opening our bottle of wine.  I know she was trying hard, but she still assured us that it was okay only to pour a glass, have cork in it, and not even notice.  To not be a jerk, I only asked for a replacement first glass, which she agreed to, but the one that she brought was clearly less full than the original one poured.

Note:  Though the restaurant name means peas...  I inquired and there seemed to be no secret pea recipe they had, so I didn't bother to try them.  My friend did and she thought they were good (but not mind blowing)

My girlfriend had the tuna entree, which was pretty bland, and honestly, not great at all. It was basically seared tuna on top of a salad with vinegar dressing. Portion was very small as well.

The beer and wine list is very short but adequate for lunch.  I had the pinot noir while my husband decided to experiment with beers - first with a chocolate milk flavored one then one with a more regular milk flavor.  I'm not a beer person but he says the second one was better.

We both started with the French onion soup.  It was okay but for the price I  (around $9) was expecting something a little more flavorful.  Also, it definitely could have been hotter.  

For the main course, my husband ordered the crab cake and I ordered the beet risotto.  Both were tasty but we both preferred the risotto.

595,2014-02-11,4.0,"I had a pleasant experience at this cozy restaurant; by the end, I was regretting that I hadn't tried this place sooner. Petit Pois serves classic French bistro food and does it well.

With my friend, I tried two appetizers, two entres, and a dessert.

To start, we had escargot and onion soup. The escargot was rich and garlicky from the standard herb butter treatment, but I found that the relative balance of butter versus herb and garlic was slightly off and would have liked to see more of the latter two. The onion soup was somewhat lighter than expected as it didn't have a rich flavor of beef stock as one typically hopes for, but they were really able to coax out a deep onion flavor that made up for it.

To continue, we had the beef short rib and the duck confit. Both came in generous portions. The beef short rib was enjoyable, and the crunchy potato was excellent--soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The only criticism I can muster is that the roasted carrots were a bit too sweet and the meat, while not dry, could have been slightly moister. The duck confit was a bit drier but still worked pretty well with the tart accompanying sauce.

To finish, we had the crme caramel (i.e. flan). The citrus and clove sauce was an excellent accompaniment and was well suited to the cold winter day on which we dined.",76.0,petitpois,0.9916,Tuesday

We had a delicious round of appetizers including French Onion Soup and Mussels which were both outstanding.  Afterwards I begrudgingly picked out the steak frites - now, I love steak frites, but they're so often disappointing at places nowadays that I feel like it's a big gamble to order them.  Thank goodness Petit Pois proved me wrong.  I'm not exaggerating even a little when I say it was absolutely the best steak frites I have ever had.  The frites were crispy, full of herbs and flavor, and the steak perfectly done with a deliciously seared crust.  Could not have asked for better.  Went great with a local Lovingston white wine which I really enjoyed.

This place is minuscule inside so make sure you plan accordingly.  Also, the entire place is in the draft zone of the door, which is incredibly annoying. They really should put a curtain or something in place to mitigate the horrible icy breeze that sweeps through the place every time someone enters or exits.  As someone who is chronically cold, that really soured the ambiance.",149.0,petitpois,0.9907,Monday

While waiting to get into another restaurant, my group of friends stopped at the very small bar inside. This place is upscale and chic with a very modern design of nice, clean lines and they were growing some grass on the bar (okay that sounds strange but it matches the modern decor). The inside bar was very small and seats only about six.

I ordered the mixed drink of the month, which consisted mostly of lemon and gin (Lemon Thyme?). It was fantastic - a great excuse to drink gin in the summer. The bar has a good selection of beer (mostly local VA beers such as Devil's Backbone and Blue Mountain Brewery), other mixed drinks, and a great wine list. We also ordered the Stinson Vineyards Ros, which I highly recommend.

The drinks and food were delicious, and the meal was made even more perfect by our fantastic server, Joellen. She was so passionate and energetic and informative about everything on the menu - and so warm -- she really made our meal.

We started out with drinks - with Joellen introducing us to a kind of wine made for several thousand years in the country of Georgia. I wasn't sure if it was what I wanted with my meal, so Joellen brought a bit for me and my husband to try.  It was lovely and interesting but not what I wanted with my dinner. But...I wasn't sure what I wanted, so after I selected my meal (with some help from her -- providing details on various dishes), Joellen offered to provide a selection of suitable pairings. She brought two white wines which she also was knowledgeable about. I tasted them both and instantly selected one to go with my fish.

We  had the chicken liver pate appetizer - the chicken is from a local farm, as are many of their ingredients. It was a mix of amazing flavors and spices and came with these perfectly buttery, toasted bread crisps. The combination was amazing.

Then my husband had the lamb meatballs and  I had the trout almondine. We both loved our dishes. The combination of flavors and elements...just lovely.

We ate outside, overlooking the fountain in the center of the pedestrian ""mall"" in Charlottesville, watching all the people enjoying the warm evening.

Steak is cooked well and surprisingly tender while the fries are just awesome.  Like, eat the whole plate and order another side awesome.  Sure you'll feel terrible after doing this but whatever.

The other food has been hit or miss, lamb meatballs were pretty good, some chicken dish was also pretty good.  Some of the sides that come with the main dishes are underwhelming.

Steak-frites gets 5 stars.  Everything else in the 3-4 star range, including the service which was fine but not exceptional.  Bonus points for cheap bottles of wine.

The service was pretty mediocre. The hostess spilled water all over my leg/foot while trying to accomplish a cool pouring maneuver. Our waiter was nice and very efficient, but he wasn't super conversational or warm. The food was really just OK, too. The bread and butter before the meal was super generic. I ordered a steak (which our waiter recommended as ""the best steak in Charlottesville""), and it was so-so. It was cooked as I requested, but the quality of the meat wasn't what I was expecting. It did have a nice herby sauce! It was served with half a plate of shoestring fries which were tasty. I wish there had been some homemade ketchup instead of a commercial brand. I tried my husband's risotto, and it was bland and definitely undercooked. It had a ton of gorgeous fresh vegetables, but it desperately needed more flavor. Our two dining companions felt equally ""meh"" about their entrees. For the two of us, it was close to $60, so we didn't feel like it was worth it (maybe more of a 2.5 star experience).

-At 8 on a Saturday there was plenty of space on their outdoor patio. We didn't have to wait at all.
-Plenty of good people watching from our seats.

The negatives (from myself and the other two visitors who are not my wife):
-Undercooked risotto. It was crunchy. The chef could have figured this out if he'd tried it, then added a little more liquid and let it cook a bit longer. (the vegetables were good and fresh though)
-The trout was bland and under seasoned
-The lamb meatballs were thrown on a plate with several other seemingly random components
-The service was lackluster (poured a lot of water on my wife while missing a glass, water glasses sat unfilled regularly, the waiter repeated our decisions right after we ordered and had 2/4 incorrect, and had to come back to make sure he had the orders right (a second time))

621,2018-04-03,4.0,"Overall, I really enjoyed Petit Pois and highly recommend trying this French-style restaurant. While the fare is a bit pricier than other selections on the Downtown Mall, PP really is a step above the rest. The decor is intimate, but rustic, with a countryside interior and a nice outside deck. As the weather cools down in the late afternoon and early evening, the deck gives a nice view of the mall, perfect for a glass of wine with friends and family. The menu offers a variety of food items, with each dish built around seasonal, fresh ingredients. Each dish our group ordered highlighted local ingredients and demonstrated a deep attention to detail. Bellow is a description of the dishes I ordered:

Coq Au Vin: While I typically steer away from ordering chicken at restaurants, this bird was cooked beautifully. The meat was moist throughout and nearly fell off of the bone. The resulting wine sauce had a deep, rich flavor with a nice saltiness. The mushroom and carrot lardon on the top complimented the meal really well, adding nice earthy and herby flavors to the dish. The buttery, purred potatoes were also well executed, providing a great base to soak up the complex flavors.

Side of Brussels Sprouts: These were fantastic; the sprouts were really well roasted, crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside. The parmesan on top added a great saltiness while the bacon offered a rich hearty tone to the meal. The portion was very generous for $5 and ranks among the top in Charlottesville. Might come back to just order wine and a side of these!

Would definitely recommend going to Petit Pois. While the place is a bit small, the food is really well done and offers a nice deviation from the typical American/Southern food found on the mall. The waitstaff was very helpful and the ambiance relaxing and inviting.",101.0,petitpois,0.9989,Tuesday

I was alone and opted to sit outside on the patio where the hostess gave me a hightop table close to the action. I ordered mussels, French onion soup, and a glass of wine. Overall, it was a-ok but didn't leave me wanting to come back for more. I was particularly letdown by the French Onion Soup. Not sure if it wasn't hot enough or what, but the cheese was a strange texture and I found it all rather bland. The mussels were more flavorful but didn't have a ton of broth to soak up with the bread which is usually the best part! 

I don't know if it was because I was by myself, but the service could've also been better. I was there for a full meal but found the waitress to be inattentive and she didn't let me know of specials which I ended up overhearing her tell neighboring tables later on in my meal... It was my first time at the restaurant so a little more warmth would be appreciated and I would've also probably got dessert but didn't want to overstay my welcome.

They did allow our dog to hang out with us which is a huge plus. It was also not terribly expensive for dinner, around $150 for four people with a bottle of wine.

661,2021-04-24,3.0,"I went here with my boyfriend to celebrate my birthday. The food was delicious--he got the crabcake and I ended up with the shrimp risotto (more on this later). The risotto was actually an appetizer but at $12 it's a super good deal as it's almost entree-sized. It was decadent and I could taste the parmesan in every bite! I tried a bit of my boyfriend's dish too--the crabcake was a little dry for my taste but overall the dish was good and he seemed to enjoy it a lot.

The service, on the other hand, was a disaster. As in, there was no service. Our server was the only employee working the front of house (there wasn't even a separate host/hostess) and had probably around 10 tables to cover. When we arrived, we waited for about 5 minutes to be seated by the server, which was fine, although the restaurant wasn't crowded at that point so that was a bit odd. I ordered the butternut squash risotto, but in our server's hurry I guess she put in the wrong order and that's how I ended up with an appetizer instead of an entree (although as I said earlier it was excellent so not a huge deal). Our server was nearly running from one table to the next the entire time we were dining, which was stressful to watch and honestly a bit distracting. We were not asked how our meal was once nor were our water glasses refilled despite being empty for 3/4 of the time we were there. Even getting our server's attention for the check was difficult because she would dash inside before we could catch her. 

Overall, the food was fantastic but this was probably the worst service I've had at a restaurant. Petit Pois should think about hiring extra staff or redistributing employee tasks, as they seem to be placing unmanageable responsibilities on their current staff.",14.0,petitpois,0.8303,Saturday
662,2021-05-09,5.0,"This is nestled in a bit of a shadowy corner of downtown, so it never caught my eye, so I am glad I found reviews online that led me here! It was easy to get seated on Saturday lunchtime, and we chose to sit outdoors (we ended up being chilly because it was blustery and out of the sun but the warm food helped).

Between four people, we decided to go family-style with the appetizers of French onion soup, lamb mergeuz soup, and gnocchi. Due to an accident, we got the shrimp risotto (uncharged that we got to keep), and it ended up being one of the best apps. The lamb mergeuz soup was delectable, very unique in flavor and well-balanced in my opinion, bringing a good earthy meaty taste alongside the tender beans and carrots. The French onion soup was done well. While the risotto looked like it had been sitting out for a moment (a bit congealed looking), it tasted phenomenal and was the best risotto I've ever had. It was not overly cheesy or buttery, just perfectly creamy held up by some of the flavor of shrimp. The gnocchi ended up being the weakest app; while the gnocchi were so tender and pillowy, the flavors were confusing, dominated by salt and strangely mingling tangy, herby, and nutty flavors. 

I personally ordered the crab cake and loved my choice. Without excess breading, the crab cake was satisfying and had an excellent flavor including notes of citrus and mustard(?) that went great with the sweet creamed corn -- I was indifferent about the spinach.

A replacement eventually arrived with kale (the waitress told us it would be Romaine!) and some tiny little cubes of processed, very un-Greek feta.
I ordered the burger, medium rare, only to be told that it only came 'pink or not pink'. I chose the pink version. When it arrived it was...
grey, soggy, tasteless maybe related to a cow but not to a burger.

Beyond that, we would need to leave.

Another worried, neighboring table received their dinners. ""Hmm...that looks like what I ordered,"" I thought.

After a few more minutes, the manager delivered something. But sadly, it wasn't our food, but rather some disappointing news. Our order was lost. It was never prepared. And it wouldn't be prepared, not in the remaining time.

Then we wanted everything on the menu, but decided to get three things and split them. We had a lovely beet, goat cheese arugula salad with a lovely citrus vinaigrette.  The beets were perfect and the dressing was divine. Then we had split the house burger with Swiss and onions and the house rosemary fries which were delectable, crispy and seasoned to perfection.  He even split the plate so we could keep it neat and didn't have to replace ourselves.  Then we split the crab cake and it too was awesome.  The corn coulis was amazing the crab was really meaty crab with an excellent but light flavor and I saw a hint of mustard seed. We then saw the table next to us endulge in profiteroles, and had to split those as well.

It is small and cramped.  They can't do anything about that.  The service has always been top notch, warm, hospitable, engaging and friendly without being over the top.  While nothing we have ever eaten there has been memorable; that isn't a slight.  Everything has always been good and of the value that we have paid.  A place like this with its' price point need to make good food that is better than what I can do at home and better than a chain or corporate ""faux"" bistro.  Along with the good food and the exceptional service they always hit the mark.
Last night was the 2nd time we have come in for a New Years Eve meal.  We live within walking distance to the downtown mall and we aren't party animals so we typically don't make NYE reservations and just walk down to the strip and see if we can saddle up at a bar somewhere.  Last week my fiancee mentioned that this year she would like to make reservations and go out.  I searched everywhere in Charlottesville and the surrounding area and all reservations were booked up.  Bummer.  So, we decided to do our regular routine, put on decent clothes and walk and see if we could slide in somewhere----our first choice as Petit Pois.  We go there and talked to the host to see if there was anything possible available, knowing the probability was low and we were OK with that.  The host checked, talked to his folks, came out and showed us to a table.  Yes, it was small and it was cramped but THEY MADE IT HAPPEN FOR US.  Everything was what we expected.  The food was good, the service as great, and the price was reasonable, and we had a nice meal and got home in time to watch the ball drop.

When I came here tonight, I realized that the location for the restaurant is close by to many places I visit regularly: downtown mall and central campus. However, despite having been to DOMA several times, I missed this store before deciding to come tonight. Fortunately, I decided to change things up today.

Public Fish & Oyster from the outside and inside looks like a homey, modern seafood bar. And its menu reflects this aesthetic: it has a small, but well composed menu of delectable seafood dishes. Tonight, I honestly had a hard time choosing what to eat from the many great selections on the menu. Luckily, I had some Yelp help: I went with some Clark Island oysters from the Raw Bar and the wine risotto. My friend ordered the grilled char. 

Both of us were extremely impressed with our personal dishes. My risotto was a beautiful wine stained color, and the wine gave a great tang to the dish that conplemented the mellow flavor of the mushrroms. My friend's char was perfectly cooked and seasoned excellently. 

The oysters were also super fresh!

703,2019-10-06,5.0,"One of my favorite spots in C'Ville!  Make sure you make a reservation because space is limited and it is a popular spot - and for good reason!

This place is a seafood restaurant and has fresh raw oysters available on the daily.  The chalkboard showcases the varietals and prices - they go from least to most briny top to bottom.  For us, we opt for the brinier the better!  Other menu features include the calamari appetizer, the clam chowder, and the moules frites!  Calamari app is enough to share and comes with some nice veggies.  The calamari is not excessively breaded so you can REALLY taste the squid.  The clam chowder is tasty and creamy and hits the spot, especially on cold days.  The moules frites is enough to share for sure!  The fra diavola is a nice veggie option with tomatoes and spice.  The chorizo sauce has a nice kick to it as well.  My favorite though is the thai-inspired broth with coconut milk!   

Most recently, we split the steampot and it was equally impressive.  For $36 you get a pot with steamed mussels, clams, shrimp and crab legs!  There are also potatoes and corn chunks in there as well.  Now, as much as I enjoyed this dish - i would still order the moules frites over this next time.  The variety was nice, but the flavor was less so - makes sense because it is steamed seafood gofigure :)

Dessert wise, we tried the key lime pie and the blackberry slump - which was described perfectly as a cobbler and a muffin combo.  The crust is definitely bready like a muffin!  The ice cream on top really complements the dessert.

Overall, we love coming here. The vibe is lively and can get a little loud, but it's still homey and unassuming.  The service is very attentive and super friendly.  Come check them out - you won't regret it!",313.0,publicfish,0.9972,Sunday
704,2020-10-07,5.0,"Wow! This spot is fantastic! Despite being small it's full of life and character. The space as I mentioned is petite but there is a patio outside as well. Their is limited seating so I recommend a reservation. The space has a beautiful bar on one side and an exposed brick wall on the other. Despite a small space it still feels like you have privacy and you don't hear more than a light murmur in the background. People were dressed semi casual with some people in dark jeans and a blouse or button up. Some people were dressed in dresses but everyone looked put together but suits are not required.

The bartender recommended a cocktail for me which was light and refreshing and they were to die for. We of course got oysters (clearly an unsaid requirement) as well as their heirloom tomato appetizer. Any time you see a restaurant with heirloom tomatoes as an appetizer you know they are going to be fresh and worth-while. And nothing disappointed! Their oyster list is expansive and they all tasted fresh. I went with someone who is a very big fan of oysters and he instantly saw two types he knew he loved and wanted. Based off what he ordered our waiter made some recommendations. Which were quite a hit. 

What brought me to the restaurant was the happy hour special ... the lobster roll! They have both Maine and Connecticut style. There is no wrong way to order a lobster roll but I got Connecticut style. It was fantastic. The meat was tender and the roll was perfectly buttery and soft. My partner's meal was equally as delicious. We both agreed this was some of the best seafood we've had here in Charlottesville.

As a big ice cream fan we had to order the house made ice cream which was creamy and flavorful. We split a key lime pie which was so delicious we might have to go back just to ensure we can have another slice! It was tart and sweet wrapped up in each little bite. The graham cracker crust was buttery and really rounded it out.

Overall an excellent meal! A great spot to have a girls lunch or meal as well as an intimate date spot. The food and service were impeccable.

My SO had never tried raw oysters before. The staff here did an awesome job explaining and recommending different oysters to try from their oyster bar. And hats off to their oyster shuckers - they make a beautiful plate and they do an awesome job at presenting a clean, ready-to-enjoy oyster. We went to another oyster bar the other day and there was a noticeable difference (couldn't even eat the oysters, it was still attached to the shell). I feel like this is one of the only places that I trust with raw oysters!

Every time we've visited, the staff have been exceptional. I think they are doing a great job at contactless dining with QR code menus and plenty of distance between tables. I've really enjoyed their outdoor dining experience as well - even on a cold November night, the heaters make things super cozy, and the ambiance is very chill (great for people watching...at a distance!) 

I still don't think Virginia can do crab cakes like Maryland (as a proud Marylander) but this place has the best Virginia crab cakes I've ever had.

Started with a cocktail, as they have a nicely put together cocktail list... The Heck Boy was great! Made perfectly and exactly what I expected based on the description in the cocktail list. I then switched to wine, as they have an interesting wine list, mostly all the unique/boutique wines that aren't the typically popular stuff, which is a nice way to try something new that might become your new favorite. In fact, while there, I tried a French white that I let a (level 2) somm friend know about and he had just had the same wine and raved about it - good options here!

I enjoyed a nice starter salad, followed by their outstanding calamari, which was very fresh and unique, with Asian flavors and Asian style cucumbers on top. Then moved on to some shrimp cocktail, which was decent, but probably the most disappointing part of the meal (reason: The shrimp was a size, slightly 2 sizes too small for traditional , hi-end restaurant shrimp cocktail and it was pre-seasoned with Old Bay style seasoning and it was definitely pre-cooked too far ahead of time to order).

The next course was the entrée! Butter poached halibut (which I got just ""the for the halubit!"") - OUTSTANDING! The carrot puree that is was sitting on top of was great! The sunchokes were interesting, but then again, this was my first time having sunchokes.

Last course was a Key Line Pie - AWESOME! And a glass of madeira to go with it - they paired nicely.

For the starters, I tried the roasted rainbow carrots and the calamari. The roasted rainbow carrots absolutely blew me away! They were creamy and the sauce was incorporated into the dish so well that every bite had flavor in it(something I would have never expected from a vegetable so simple). The calamari was pretty fresh too and not oily but a little hard to chew. Then, for the entree, we got the duo of jumbo crab cakes, which also were very fresh but a little too salty for me.

723,2022-06-25,5.0,"I was visiting Charlottesville for the day with my girlfriend. We decided that we wanted seafood while visiting the mountain community of Charlottesville. We found this restaurant online. It had good ratings, so we gave it a try.

I started with the New England Clam Chowder. OMG! It was so smooth...typically. I add pepper to any New England Clam Chowder. Not this one. It was perfectly seasoned and the broth was so creamy and smooth, and there were plenty of clams.

Not long after, the Steamer Pot arrived. It was steaming and very well seasoned. We had 2 small clusters of crab legs, a whole mess of clams, 8 huge shrimp, a couple of potatoes, and 1 ear of corn.

Everything tasted fresh. My meal paired well with my drink, a Bloody Mary.  The mix used in the Bloody Mary was delicious.  I tasted a pepper flavor, but almost like a lightly burnt pepper flavor that I had not tasted in other mixes. It is spiced perfectly for me - not too hot; not too mild.

There was plenty of food in this steamer pot for two. Looking back, it was a bigger bowl of New England Clam Chowder than I expected. The prices are fair for the food and service you receive. The staff are wonderful! And the bartenders are exceptionally skilled. 

At the end of our Steamer Pot, I requested a whiskey sour. I enjoy a good whiskey sour.  I am not ashamed to say, tonight I enjoyed a great whiskey sour. I don't know what he did to make that drink so smooth. It was the perfect balance of the sour mix, the whiskey, and butter. That drink was buttery smooth. 

Overall, my girlfriend and I agree that the food was delicious. Good job, cooks/chefs. The service was fantastic! Everyone was friendly and out of the way helpful.  The ambiance was nice. It was cozy inside. And the barkeeps were on their game. The drinks were amazing.

We will be returning to this hidden gem. A great dining experience.",16.0,publicfish,0.9984,Saturday

Our drinks were mixed very well. Good selection of spirits. My boyfriend ordered clam chowder and good lort. It's the food you eat when it winter, you don't feel good, okay anytime...it was the best clam chowder I've had since Massachusetts. We got the steamer pot and split it. Steamer pots I'm associated with at OBX are usually huge and feed 3 people. This one is smaller. I saw another couple each having their own but I couldn't eat a whole one by myself. It was so yummy. The staff, waitress and bartender we all very nice and cracking jokes. Great atmosphere.

cons: our main dishes --fish of the day (seared ahi curry) and the hodgepodge -- were very lackluster. I had to ask for salt for the hodgepodge because the taste was so one-note. The sauce was missing the usually freshness of seafood. Not worth the price.",57.0,publicfish,0.7367,Monday
726,2022-07-07,2.0,"Summary: all the food LOOKS very good but TASTES bad. 

Full review: To get to the point, it seems like this place has really good ideas for food but hasn't quite gotten to the point of making it taste good. It was super busy the night we visited, but we nabbed some bar seats right as we went in.

We got a bunch of oysters that were pretty standard. The special was a ""rare ahi tuna"" that was closer to ""100% cooked for 1 cm and completely raw for the rest."" The fish actually looked really good but the texture combination of raw+cooked did not work. The curry underneath, a bog standard red thai curry, was great with the rice.

The Hodgepodge lived up to it's named and there was actually quite a lot of mussel. Unfortunately the soup base was weak and the entire bowl needed a lot of salt to bring the flavor out. The table bread that accompanied was also just a small stick of white that left a lot to be desired.",10.0,publicfish,0.9834,Thursday
727,2022-07-26,5.0,"A great seafood spot! Their oyster selection impressed me on my first visit last year, so this time I came back to enjoy a full meal. 

The service was great throughout the night and our server was very attentive and friendly. We ended up ordering a round of oysters and shrimp cocktail and it was just as tasty as I remembered--highly recommended for those who love a good briny set of oysters! 

*Shrimp po-boy - this was a tasty entree and wile I wouldn't say it was the best ever, it certainly hit the spot. The fries that came with it were excellent and happened to be my favorite style of fries. They also give you a ton so you'll likely leave stuffed.

*Brussels sprouts - these were really good. The sauce that these are prepared/mixed in really made these stand out from the usual Brussel sprouts from other restaurants. Would certainly order again. 

*Chicken sandwich - wife ordered this and she enjoyed her selection as well. This also came with a mountain of fries so she too, walked out of these stuffed.

729,2022-08-07,3.0,"Came here last night to dine in. I've been here at least 5 times now and it's clear there is quite a bit of inconsistency in both the quality of service and food. 
I made a reservation for dinner at 6 pm and they were sold out of the lobster rolls. I was a bit sad about that. I guess I just missed it bc the people that were sat next to us got lobster rolls. 
We ordered two drinks and oysters before the happy hour ended at 6 pm. Only Virginia oysters have a dollar discount during happy hour. 
I ordered their steak frites and my friend got the sockeye salmon. 
The drinks came out first naturally but the bartender who brought the drink winked at my friend making her feel uncomfortable. 
Then to my surprise, the main food came out first before the oysters. I thought the order for oysters were placed first and they are appetizers. When I inquired about why the oysters haven't come out first, the waitress said that their oysters come from all over the place so it takes a while for them to get them ready. Also, she mentioned that there is no particular order of how the food comes out. 
I was confused at that explanation. Appetizers should come out before the main? The oysters come from everywhere?? I mean, shouldn't they have the oysters in house already?? I clearly saw them at the front when I was checking in at the restaurant on a pile of ice. 
The fries during this visit was soggy and over cooked. During my previous visits, the fries were nice, crisp, and yellow. not greasy and dark looking. Perhaps the humidity had something to do with it?

I also felt like I was being looked down upon during this visit. Not sure why though. Students are on summer break so the majority of people dining in were the age group of the students' parents. We were one of the youngest diners here. Felt like I was being judged based on how I was dressed and being a younger generation who couldn't afford being here. 

I really like their lobster rolls, but I think over the years, my conclusion is that this place is a hit or miss on their service and quality of food.",722.0,publicfish,0.9666,Sunday

Danny and Zoe were amazing and engaging. Danny made me feel like this was my old hangout. I ordered the hh oysters which were good my only drawback was the horseradish didn't have enough kick. 

I was lucky enough to score one of their lobster rolls and it was amazing on top of that I was given the option of salad or fries. I chose the salad to eat while there and it was huge with field greens. 

To finish out and take back to my hotel I took the fries and asparagus. The aoli that comes with the fries was garlicky in a great way and I even dipped a piece of asparagus in to try.

Service - borderline rude.  The woman that waited on us was not in the mood to be at work that night.  A lot of sighing.  Never returned to our table.  We finally had to send the manager to find her after getting our food and, after 15 minutes, she had still not checked with the table.  At the end of the night, as we were leaving, I said, ""Thanks,"" and she just looked at me.  Not the warm, fuzzy feeling that we've gotten in the past.

Food - Not great, like in the past.  The calamari was swimming in ?soy sauce?  and the clam chowder was 85% potatoes.  The shrimp po-boy was tasty, though.  Drinks were good.  

Ambiance - okay.  The open but covered room was mostly large groups so that was super noisy.  The main room was the same as usual, just tight.

Everything tastes extremely fresh and the meat is plump. Super delicious, a must get especially for oyster lovers. 
We also got the fresh Maine lobster rolls (Maine style) with salad. If we hadn't gotten fries earlier in the day we would've ordered it with fries which looked crispy and delicious. Finally, we also got a New England clam chowder which was pretty good.

We got to our reservation on time and had the worst seat in the restaurant, we were sandwiched between two tables and extremely close to the bar. I completely understand tables have to be close together especially in a busy restaurant on a Saturday night but it was hard for the waitress to get to us and I felt like it was almost used as an excuse to be neglected. When we ordered we ordered everything together because again, it was hard for our waitress to get to our table. We ordered a dozen oysters, a $90 bottle of wine and I got the moules frites and my husband got the shrimp linguini and I also got the ABC bread to dip in the broth of the mussels. I should have mentioned we wanted the oysters as an app but assumed it was an appetizer and the entrees would come after, but the waitress also never asked. We got everything all together, which was such a pain. Since the table was small I had to put the mussels bucket on the floor and we barely had any room for anything. I know I should have mentioned to get the appetizer first, but I also think the waitress should have asked. At a nice restaurant, they need to ask. I also never got the bread. 
The worst part was after we got the food, the waitress literally never came back. Never came back to ask how the food turned out, no water refills, no asking if we wanted something else to drink, literally nothing. So I couldn't even tell her the bread was missing. She was also very attentive to the table next to us, so I cant even blame it on her seeming to be busy. When she finally came back, when the restaurant was basically closing, we mentioned the bread. She brought it out and with extra and took it off our tab. She acted like she was doing a huge favor taking it off the tab, like thanks? The broth was cold by then and it was $4, I wasnt worried about paying for it, I actually wanted it with my meal.
All that being said, the food was very good, and the restaurant was beautiful. I would love to try it again and hope that it was just an off night.

We weren't drinking, but if I find myself in Charlottesville again, I'm gonna try their signature old fashioned with VA Bourbon. 

The deviled eggs had enough mustard to cut through the extra creamy blend with a shard of bacon on each that elevated them beyond normal. The jalapeño cornbread was a sublime mix of sweet and heat. 

The chicken was perfectly cooked and the carrots roasted to a turn. They were just starting to soften on the outside while still crispy in the center.  I truly enjoyed the roasted pearl
onions which popped in your mouth like flavor bombs. The mashed potatoes where divinely blended.  The grace notes with the rosemary spear and the seasoned salt surrounding the dish so you could spice to preference, individually, on each bite were brilliant.

I realize that there has been a pandemic and that hiring/staffing/training are extremely challenging.

Opening moment. I'm standing with my party of 15 are the host stand.  A server (not eventually our server) informed me: ""Get out of the way!""  No please, no apology, no grace.  By the way, the restaurant was completely empty at this point, and all other ""nice"" Charlottesville restaurants were entirely booked. I should have clued in at this point...

The wine, beer and cocktails: Great, no complaints. 

The food.  Two plates of RAW oysters came out that were *hot* to the touch. I've never seen this in all my years...

I ordered steak frites (medium).  The steak was bland, over-cooked and tasteless. The fries were mushy as if in a soup.  I didn't know this dish could be so mishandled.

I waited at the hostess stand for several minutes and a young lady who was a server came up to the stand and asked me what I'd like to order, which was very odd.  I asked her if I could be seated and she took me to a table.  I then told her that I was ready so I ordered a glass of wine and a wedge salad then asked for a glass of water because I'm very thirsty. Then, I waited....another woman came out to bring me my salad, which was delicious.  I told her that I had not gotten my water or glass of wine.  She apologized and said that my wine would be comped, which was very thoughtful.  I ate my salad and waited for 10 minutes to ask for my check, the server never came out of the kitchen.  I asked another server if he would tell my server that I went out to the bar area with my wine and I'd like my check.  I finished my glass of wine and still no server.  I finally found her and asked her for my check.  I did let her know that I was not satisfied with the service and she apologized.
My take, don't come to eat at 2:15pm because you will be ignored.  Sad, this is a beautiful hotel but I doubt that I'd ever eat here again.

First off, we pulled into the Valet parking, and they told us that parking was for hotel guests only, and that we would have to find a parking garage which was a couple blocks away.  That's crap.  He did show us a lot across the way which was sketchy at best.

Next we checked in with the hostess and as we were walking to our table she asked if we wouldn't mind sharing a menu.  Really.....out of menu's.  She seated us at a small table and we asked if we could have the table near the window so we can keep an eye on the lot where our car was parked.  The floor manager came by and said that that table was reserved and people had reservations and were waiting.  I said, we had reservations too, and she (Kim is her name) rudely insisted that we take our table because the other table was reserved.  At that point we almost walked out...We opted to at least try the cuisine.

After a few minutes, the server finally came, by that time we had all our choices made.  I ordered the Ribeye and my wife ordered the Crab Cakes. (all different than online menu)  My wife orders a white wine with her entrée and I ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon with mine.  She got her White and I also received a white.  As she was scurrying away I called her back and told her I ordered a red.  She said let me check to see what you ordered.  Really....I know what I ordered and a cab is a red.  She came back and said the Bartender made the mistake. 

The food did come a little over 10 minutes from order (we had a timer going) which was impressive.  My wife said the crab cakes were pretty good and my ribeye was good, not great and a restaurant of this caliber ought to be.  The steak was on top the mashed potatoes and asparagus and when I went to cut the steak and the mashed potatoes oozed out from under the steak and all the steak juice was in the potatoes which I would rather pool on the place to swab my bites in. 

In summary, sounds like the restaurant is for guests only, based on no parking for outsiders.  Kim the floor manager is rude and there were not enough menu's.  Food was good, not great, which a restaurant of this caliber should present.

By the way, at the time we were leaving, nobody was ever seated at the table by the window we requested.  They merged it with another table which STILL, nobody was sitting at when we left.  So Kim lied to us!  No reservations for a small table.

The location from our hotel was walking distance..perfect location. The ambiance was very nice. A few of us arrived early and had an adult beverage prior to dinner. Very nice and relaxing at the bar. 
Our large group arrived and was seated at two separate tables, with two completely different servers. So basically they broke us up into a party of 8? Which was surprising to me. So tell me why do we need to  order from shortened menu, with a party of 8? Servers wouldn't budge, even though we were now a party of 8 people, with 1 check for each group. Keep in mind we had 2 separate servers. Pretty disappointed with this process. 

Overall the food was average, nice portions. Our server was less than stellar, took along time to get our drinks to table and to take our order. I haf th cajun pasta and added blackened chicken. Food came, and the chicken was not blackened at all. Server made a comment it had sear marks..?  Our other group had some food cooking temp issues with chicken. Our group had to insist with their server it wasnt prepared to proper cooking temp and chicken had visible signs of red colors. The dish was Sent back to finish cooking and after 30 minutes passed the food came back out. By this time every person in the party had finished eating. This person was very upset and her server did nothing to make it right. 
I'm being very generous with a 2 star rating. I feel the setup for out group was not right..the service was less than adequate and the food prices for this lack of food options, quality and service was horrific.

Shrimp and grits that were overly spicy and curdled. No creamy here. Cobb salad that was tasteless. Cornbread that was dense and undercooked. Again.

There is nothing on this menu that stands out as unique. Nothing about the food seemed freshly made, which can be fine for some people. Seeing as this place is attached to a hotel, it makes sense why everything comes prepackaged and then assembled.

I really try to avoid bad or even mid star reviews.  But my family and I are in town to celebrate a wedding and wanted to try The Ridley out for dinner.  

We were able to make a reservation on open table for a Friday night at the time we wanted which was great.  We were seated right away, and greeted with water and our waitress fairly quickly.

Hurriedly, she said she would be right back to take our drink order... at least 20 minutes later, we finally make eye contact and she rushes over and verbatim says ""I'm so sorry, I completely forgot about you"" .... yikes!

At this point we've wised up to what's going on and luckily knew to put our drink and dinner orders at the same time. 

We get the food before our drinks, never a good sign... my lobster roll was okay, but the fries were cold.  Dad's burger was good, cooked how he likes but nothing special, his fries were warm.  Mom's salad was good, but needed pepper, it took another 10 minutes to get our waitress to come back for something simple.

Finally, our drinks were made and brought out over 1/2 way through dinner (this is about 30 minutes after we've ordered them).  Again, our waitress rushes over ""I'm sorry for the delay, our bartenders are terrible"" sets the drinks down and then rushes off to God knows where, because she wasn't checking on other tables either. The thing I'd been looking forward to after a long day of travel was their Old Fashioned (my favorite and go to cocktail), presentation was good but the drink was unfortunately mixed terribly, took one sip and didn't touch the drink after.  For $21 you expect it to at least taste correct.

Another 15 minutes or so after we've finished our meal we have to flag her down yet again to get our check.  Another table locally was waiting to pay their bill for at least 20-25 minutes for her to come back. 

Overall, the experience was a letdown and I feel like with a different and more experienced waitress the meal and experience could have been salvaged.",16.0,ridley,0.5519,Saturday

She returned several minutes later to let me know they were out of the items to make the extra credit passion fruit cocktail, so I ordered the wahoo daiquiri instead, my date had ordered an unsweetened tea; which had yet to arrive in this time frame. We sat and talked and waited for our appetizers to arrive. My drink arrived about 15 minutes later and we began to wonder about our food. At which time, we'd been waiting awhile since placing the order and had watched several couples/parties come in after us and get their appetizers by now. 45 minutes in to being there, we finally got our appetizers. The cornbread was hot and delicious. The shrimp cocktail was warm and slimy, not so great. We both ordered the chicken and waffles and it came out not long after our appetizers; which didn't surprise us. The chicken was hot and flavored well. The waffles had so much cinnamon butter on them, it made them cold to eat. But when put together, it wasn't bad. When it came time to order desert, one of the reasons I chose this specific restaurant for dinner, they stated they didn't have the crème brûlée that was on the restaurant week menu. That it hadn't set and wasn't available, so they could offer the banana pudding or a slice of cheesecake with berries. What a disappointment this was. After the terrible service we had, this just ruined any good that had come from the food. We ordered the cheesecake to go and when it came out in the to go containers, it was more of a sliver than a slice. It looked like they took a slice and cut it on half to share with two people. We paid our bill and asked the server for a bag to carry out the to go containers in and she stated she would be back with it, to which she never did. We had to ask her 3 additional times for the bag before we finally got one to use. This was one of the worst service experiences in dining I've had. The cornbread was amazing and I would come just for that. But the rest lacked anything to be desired.

The bad service was very clearly an ongoing issue and unrelated to our party size. Our server was extremely slow and never bothered to ask if we wanted refills. The kitchen was also bad. Everyone's meals came out at different times, and took forever. We were there just over two hours but not because we were leisurely enjoying our meals - over half our table got salads and two others got sandwiches and one set of ribs. While I could understand the ribs taking some time, they were actually the first out of the kitchen. One salad didn't even come until after everyone else had finished. I personally got a Caesar salad with steak cooked med rare. The steak was more well done and the salad wasn't even tossed and the dressing tasted like it had gone bad. Also of note, several people got the same salad, but they came out looking completely different. For example - two people got the beet salad but one came out in a large bowl and had goat cheese and other little bits but the other was on a small side plate without any cheese or anything. Same with the Caesar salads - all the plates were different. By the end, we could not wait to leave. For an Autograph Collection hotel, this restaurant was an absolute miss.

Both of the plates actually bounced. She left and never returned, although she was racing around the nearly empty restaurant the entire time we were seated with no apparent purpose, obviously angry at the world, not just us. After we were seated, we waited another ten minutes before I got up to go find a server, as none had appeared.

I went and spoke with the manager about the situation, more as constructive feedback than as ""I'm so angry and want free dessert"", and she seemed to appreciate it.  As I sat down after talking to her, the waitress came up to our table and said ""I'm sorry you've had such an unpleasant evening"".

Now, I'm not normally a 2-star rater, but this is definitely all Ten is worth.  This place came highly recommended, so I expected to be blown away, but instead was completely turned off.

The service was so bad I am embarassed and ashamed for them.

We were celebrating a very special milestone birthday for a close friend, and when I told the waiter he just looked at me blankly and said, 'Oh' (as in 'Oh, big deal').  There was no comp'd drink or free dessert or anything.  Our bill came to a whopping $271.08 and not even one measly free edamame pod??

Another problem we had with our waiter is that we complained about the stupidly expensive wild sashimi platter (Omakase) we had which HE had recommended - it was so below average and we were very unimpressed.  We asked him several times to relay our message to his management and/or the sushi chef.  His response was, ""My roommate is the sushi chef, I'll tell him later"".  I should have told him we'd pay him ""later"", then.  If there's ever a place I wanted to do a dine-n-dash, this was it.

I should mention that the calamari appetizer was delicious, and the crab sushi roll was fairly tasty.  Everything else was meh.

We arrived at 6:15 on a Tuesday evening.  The restaurant was almost empty.  There were 2 tables set to accommodate larger groups (6+) but the remaining 7 booths in the front of the space were empty.  We were sat at a small table that is awkwardly set between booths and in front of the waiters' computer and when I asked whether we could sit in one of the many empty booths we were told no, that they were planning on being too busy.  This was upsetting enough, but I thought that maybe there was something I was unaware of.  Nope.  By the time we left maybe 75 minutes later the restaurant was just as empty as when we arrived.  I should have just walked out when we were told No.  Alas, we didn't.

Besides the maitre d, the server was friendly enough.  No real complaints there.  And the food was fine.  Not even close to worth the price.  Even a simple cucumber roll is $5 (a tool by which I often measure the priceiness of sushi restaurants.  Even my favorite hoity toity DC sushi place only has $4 cucumber rolls).

He only checked on us twice during the dinner, and the second time was when we were done eating and if we would be ordering something else (after he recommended that we should probably get another plate of food), when we told him we were done, he walked away looking very irritated and promptly brought us our check.

That being said, the interior looked nice and anything good I have to say about Ten will stop there. 

Ten can jack up their prices because they have the best fish in Charlottesville. Sadly, that isn't saying a whole lot. I've paid $10+ for the standard 2 piece nigiri selections once in my life somewhere in Beverly Hills, and for as good as it was, it still hurts to pay that much. But $10 for two pieces of salmon? In Charlottesville? If the fish was monstrous I might not have been as annoyed, but it was your average sized piece of sushi.

It was my fault that I didn't look more carefully at the online menu disclaimer stating that the price was per piece and not for a two piece serving, so when I got there with my parents to treat them to dinner, I was caught off guard and couldn't work up the nerve to get up and find someplace else to eat after we'd already been seated and looked at the menus. I probably should have.

For me, the decent quality of the food merited at least three stars. The pricing dropped it down to two. The staff nuked it into a one.

""You can have the Asian table""
""F**k that, and get no tips? It's your turn anyway.""

The guy that tried to hand us off was midsentence responding when they saw me walk by.

I've been spoiled rotten by too many all-you-can-eat sushi places in New York, and short of miracle fatty tuna, I can't justify to myself shelling out $10 for a measly few pieces. It really is too bad that Charlottesville is stupidly land-locked, and this place has pretty much got the fish market cornered; I can count on one hand the (good) Japanese restaurants in town. I had already lined my stomach plenty before coming and wanted to get my alcohol on, but let me just say something first about the ambiance of this place: 

First, you're totally paying for the gorgeous 30-foot high ceilings, the cascading light display they've got next to the bar, and the quiet hush that comes when people are trying not to think about how much money they're eating. Second, I want to design my dream home's bathrooms after their bathrooms here. Minimalist Zen. 

FYI - you can't sit in the booths or at the tables without ordering some food. I like how they set up a lounge area but it's still quite tiny and when we left around at around 10:30 on Friday, it had gotten quite crowded. One $10 mojito was good enough for me. Heard good things about the magenta Setting Sun drink. Our waitress was so nice - she offered to split our six-party bill before we asked.

I agree with most of my fellow Yelpers here, sushi quality is not anything out of this world. 

Coming here with a possible love interest is nice, on group dates though? Not so much.  

My date and I ordered off a special dinner menu, which provided the option of a three course meal for $30 each. Every dish presented was supplied with a quantity suitable for a baby. These appetizers and entrées were also on the original menu, but because they put it on a separate sheet of laminated paper and deemed it as an ""exclusive offer,"" they could legitimately cut down on the portions. Sushi, again, was so-so. Where your money goes to is the aesthetics, but given, taste was not bad either, quite tender for meats. During the dinner, my boyfriend has the tendency to joke around with me, hinting at the idea of me footing the bill. I honestly don't mind, but it's ironic when he lightly hits my hand when I try to grab the check. Points for humor and chivalry. Details, ladies. 

Explanatory summary: after what was one of the most memorable nights of my life, we scurried back to our dorms where my boyfriend had to make ramen to quench the growling that persisted. Before I passed out on the bed, I heedlessly noted to myself that the food experience is what matters, good or bad. I will simply and properly feed myself the next morning instead.

12,2013-03-22,4.0,"Ten is without a doubt the best sushi you can find in Charlottesville! You might accidentally walk right past it the first time because there is just a small door to a stairway that leads up to the main restaurant. 

The skewers aren't worth the money in my opinion. The waygu beef skewers are cooked nicely, but the chicken can be overcooked and the portions are pretty small. For those who are looking for a non-seafood option, try  the wagyu tenderloin topped with truffled herb wasabi butter. My sister hates sushi so she chose the steak instead and it was really flavorful and tender. Other than the tenderloin, I have found their other non-sush options underwhelming. 

The sushi is very fresh here and what I really love about Ten is that they use freshly grated wasabi! I don't usually use much of the green blob that's usually served with sushi, but the fresh wasabi has a wonderfully different flavor that goes so well with the fish. They have plenty of specialty rolls which have never disappointed. My top picks include their rainbow roll, soft shell crab roll, and dragon [eel] roll. 

I think that they're sushi prices are reasonable and comparable to what you would find in D.C. Since they don't have much competition, they are probably not pressured to keep prices low. 

Service used to be awesome here--the waiters were professional and super personable. Over the years, I feel like their service has become spotty and a little inconsistent. For example, the last time I visited, our waitress was impersonal and seemed a little flustered. I don't know if she was just having a bad night or what--- but it resulted in a slightly awkward experience.

My only regret is we went to Clifton Inn for one of our other daughter's 21st in February before we knew about this place. You can see my review of the other experience but there's no need to speak of it now.

Ten is lovely. Simple yet lush. Understated. The food is creative as are the drinks. The sake selection is large for a ""big city"" joint to say nothing of its peers in Cville.

My default whenever I go to a new sushi spot is the sashimi. A good sushi chef can turn this simple dishi into a opulent, decadent experience. On my first visit, my wife actually tried my sashimi. She had never eaten it before and was curious because of the presentation. She almost ate all my sashimi. 

A very good sushi chef. Very good fish. Quality ingredients and quality chefs mean this isn't a cheap sushi joint. But what you get is excellent and a value.

Beyond the sushi and sashimi, Chef has a varied menu with great daily specials and imaginative creations that will please purists to fusionistas.

But it's not a place - as you can see from some of the reviews - for hipster hopefuls with limited budgets hoping to cop the air of sophistication without truly appreciating or understanding (or affording) what they're doing. It's not a raucous party spot and it's not really good for loud parties.

Since it is located right on the mall off of 2nd Street, parking is a breeze since you can park in the Water Street garage or the Water Street lot. A short two minute walk and vola! Sushi!

The appearance of the inside of the restaurant is very sleek and modern; very inviting and intriguing. In the evening time, it is nice and dark (not too dark, just the perfect brightness level, if you can imagine that). I have taken my lady out here on numerous occasions (she is a sushi lover as well), and she feels the atmosphere and design is romantic, and I have to agree with her.

It features a full bar, booths, tables for larger parties, and small tables as well - perfect for that one-on-one date kind of scenario.

Art unfolds in front of your eyes, as fish, other ingredients, and their mouth watering sushi rice all come together to make the perfect concoction of sushi your tastebuds will ever get the opportunity to taste.

The waiters and waitresses are extremely knowledgeable about the menu. You can enter totally clueless in the world of sushi, and leave a walking sushi-pedia of delicious knowledge.

I have literally tried every type of sushi that they have on their menu, and not once have I ever been disappointed. They really are masters of their craft.

Usually when I review restaurants, price can play a factor in determining the overall rating of the establishment. However in this case, it is sushi - for quality sushi you shouldn't expect to get it for cheap or any sort of bargain price. Ten is not a cheap place to eat by any means, but the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere you will be receiving in exchange for your hard earned dollars is well worth it.

If you are looking for bargain sushi that comes no where near the quality of Ten, feel free to go to your local Asian buffet and serve up a plate of that amateur train wreck of a meal they call sushi.

Don't get me wrong, the sake (salmon) and other normal cuts of sashimi were still great, but it turns out their sushi chef opened his own restaurant on the downtown mall (Mican), and I'm not sure if the replacement has the same kind of experience with the cuts of tuna. 

Service was great, and the harami miso was still delicious, but the oh toro (very fatty tuna cut) was not the same cut as we had last year (that was melt-in-your-mouth good). I no longer can say I feel that it was worth the $8, though it was still good tuna. Just not oh toro, which made me a little sad.",103.0,Ten Sushi,0.901,Tuesday

24,2017-07-22,1.0,"I don't often leave reviews. But TEN committed attempted manslaughter tonight, so I felt the need to write a small note in response. 

My wife and I booked a table for two for Restaurant Week. We were explicit on the reservation about her severe, anaphylaxis-inducing allergy to both peanuts and tree nuts. We reminded the waiter of the allergy when we arrived, and asked that every dish be checked with the chef to make sure there were no nuts. (I'm free from any such restrictions, but it's a Japanese restaurant, so of course we wanted to share, and in any event, I wasn't interested in ruining a date night by rendering myself unable to kiss my wife). 

First course arrives: beef tartare roll, and very pretty ahi tuna with avocado...and pine nuts. Not listed on the menu, but literally covering the entire dish. I called the waiter over and noted the nuts on the plate. He immediately apologized. We asked if he had actually checked dishes with the chef, and he admitted that while he might have done so for my wife's order, he didn't do so for mine. I ordered a different appetizer and he left. 

I admit, we probably should've just picked up and left at that point. We were feeling really uncertain about whether this place was taking her food allergy seriously. And no disrespect to any of my friends with intolerances to gluten or dairy (restaurants should take that shit seriously as well) but a nut allergy is life-and-death stuff. But we had this date planned, and it was already 8 pm, so we decided the best course of action was to ask to see the manager. 

A few minutes after I inquired at the host station, the manager shambles to our table. ""Hi.""  A blank stare. I thought, ok, maybe they didn't tell him what happened, and so I explained about my wife's allergy and the dish with the nuts.  More blank stare. I said, ""hey, we're not trying to get anyone in trouble, and we're not looking for a handout, we just wanna be sure you're not gonna bring anything else out of the kitchen with nuts in it. It could kill my wife."" The entire response:

""Only use nuts on the salads and that dish. You're fine. I guess I'll double check.""

We never saw him again. 

The waiter gave us a discount essentially amounting to 20% off. Which, again, I'm not here to quibble about. Too many people think one mistake by a server entitles them to a free supper. But I really just don't think this place took at all seriously their obligation to serve food that was safe for their customers. Which should be a baseline thing for any spot taking your money in exchange for a bite to eat, whether it's a greasy spoon or (in this case) an expensive fine-dining spot.  And so we won't go back, and we recommend that you skip it as well.",1.0,Ten Sushi,0.0892,Saturday
25,2017-12-19,5.0,"I CAN'T GET OVER THIS PLACE. Like I can't stress that enough. I still think about it sometimes and could honestly cry. I was amazed from the second I stepped foot in the building. The place is simple, modern, and clean. They have a beautiful setup and bar. I love the atmosphere-- it makes you feel like a million dollars and makes you want to just spend your entire bank account there. 

For the appetizers, I ordered the udon and tiger shrimp. The udon was pretty good but just a tad on the salty side. The tiger shrimp was amazing. The sauce on those shrimp was to die for. It was also served on a bed of seaweed salad which gave it a nice touch. I ordered the wagyu beef roll and the soft shell crab roll. They were both very good. The soft shell crab roll was served in four larger rolls while the beef was in eight rolls. Although this place is on the pricier side, I genuinely believe it's worth it given the service and experience. I would definitely come back and try some of their drinks as well!",196.0,Ten Sushi,0.9827,Tuesday
26,2018-01-28,4.0,"Came here for restaurant week, and I came out really on the fence about the meal. On one hand, the food was very good. Besides the ramen (which I will talk about a little below), the flavors were really great. The dishes were executed really well and the service seemed really attentive. The ambiance is great too, with a modern Japanese decor resembling the contemporary fare. For the $35 menu, I thought the portions were good (enough to satisfy your cravings, but not over-fill you) and the menu extensive enough to offer a variety of entree options. I ordered the below dishes:

Kitsune Udon: This udon were firm but chewy and grounded the soup really well. The warm broth had a light, salty, but bold umami flavor. Great appetizer portion that introduced the rest of the meal.

Abura Ramen: For my second noodle dish, I was expecting a similar broth, but Ten's take on this dish includes all of the fixings without a broth to dilute the flavor. The egg was perfectly cooked-firm whites on the outside and a glossy yolk in the middle. The pork had a great chewiness and salty flavor to complement the egg and noodles. What really stood out was the mushroom and tomago paste on the side. Incorporating these in with the noodles elevated the dish and added a creamy but light base to the ramen. The noodles themselves were very good, but still tasted a bit dry and disconnected with the dish. Even when you incorporate the pastes and the yolk, I would recommend adding a light sauce (other than the oil currently there) to round out the plate.

Nigiri Omakase: this dish was really good. The plate includes 4 nigiri hand chosen by the chef (these change daily). If you can order the Walu, this one was by far the best. The quality of each fish is spectacular and really showcased the knife, preparation, and plating skills of the chef. My only recommendation is to cut down on the amount of wasabi in each piece. I really like having the kick to balance out the butteriness of the fish, but in at least two of the pieces, the wasabi definitely took away from the delicate flavors.

Overall, I'm happy with my experience at Ten. The dishes were simple but well seasoned and executed. Ten uses really fresh ingredients, which brings out complex flavors without over thinking the dishes. Would definitely come back to try more maki rolls and modern entree items.",101.0,Ten Sushi,0.998,Sunday
27,2018-04-02,5.0,"I'm speechless. My recent experience at Ten was incredible. From the food, atmosphere, to the service- everything was on point.

When you first enter the door, there is a staircase right in front of you (staircase to heaven filled with amazing food). The staircase is pretty long and can be difficult to walk on with heels- just a warning. Once you get upstairs, you see beautiful lights along the wall. The ambiance of this place is super classy and romantic. This place is perfect for date nights. 

My date and I ordered several things to share including: 
-Udon: The best udon I've ever had. It was so light and savory. The noodles were super soft yet chewy.  Also, my favorite thing about this dish was that it was piping hot which was great on a cold night.
-Unagi Sansho: This roll came with freshwater eel, Japanese peppercorn, and unagi sauce. It was so simple yet so delicious. The unagi was well seasoned and paired well with the peppercorn. Dip this in some soy sauce with wasabi and you've got a party in your mouth.
-Soft-shell crab roll: The roll's presentation caught my eyes. As for the taste, equally as appealing. The soft shell crab was crunchy and just the right level of saltiness. Definitely give it a try!
-Tiger Roll: It included prawns and unagi with a spicy sauce. The prawns were so meaty. This roll is worth trying! 
-Japanese Wagyu Beef Roll: MY FAVORITE. I cannot stress enough about how good this was. The beef was incredibly tender and well seasoned- it paired perfectly with the avocado. It just melted in my mouth. Oh my goodness, I still dream about this dish everyday. Just wow. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend this restaurant. It's pricey but the quality is so worth it. If you're a huge foodie like me, you'll love this place.",221.0,Ten Sushi,0.9952,Monday

29,2018-03-17,3.0,"I went to Ten for a Friday night dinner date. 

Pros: Sophisticated ambiance, knowledgeable waiter, good Sake options.

Cons: Very expensive, some dishes have farm-raised fish, appetizer and dessert portion sizes do not justify the $$$. 


Ten gets an A+ for ambiance. The dim lighting, background music, upstairs location on the downtown mall, sleek grey booths, and high ceilings give the restaurant a cosmopolitan feel. The interior of the restaurant is one of the most sophisticated in Charlottesville. Perfect setting for a chic date or girls night out.

The food is very good but not outstanding. Considering the high price point of this restaurant, I expected more. Honestly, the sushi was of similar quality to other (much more affordable) Japanese restaurants that I have visited. 

For our appetizer we ordered the rock shrimp. Half of the shrimp was coated in a spicy creme sauce and the other half in a sweet wasabi sauce. I highly recommend this for an appetizer order. However, the portion size was small for a $12 order. 

We ordered four sushi rolls for dinner. The Maguro Karai Honey, Stella Blue Crab Roll, Unagi Sansho, and Ebi Tempura. Some rolls have eight pieces while others have six. The sushi was good- what you would expect from a respectable sushi restaurant - but it wasn't stellar. I assumed that the fish would be wild-caught considering the pricey menu at Ten, but the waiter informed me that the crab and shrimp were farm-raised (farm-raised fish are often raised in controversial conditions). This was disappointing. 

For dessert we ordered the green tea mochi and warm chocolate cake. I would recommend the warm chocolate cake. The vanilla ice cream compliments the warm inside of the cake. 

For drinks, I recommend getting a Sake flight and then ordering a glass of your favorite kind. Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable about the different Sake options. I enjoyed my glass of the ""Little Lily"" Sake.",20.0,Ten Sushi,0.9951,Saturday
30,2018-09-04,5.0,"Ten is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlottesville. Throughout my 4 years in Charlottesville, I have probably been to this restaurant at least 7 times. The restaurant itself is very elegant and it is located on the Downtown mall which always opens up the opportunity of taking a night stroll after our stomachs are stuffed from the excellent food. 

Service: The staff is always incredibly friendly and super knowledgeable. They are always willing to share with you their favorite dishes and are never trying to upsell you on anything -- in fact, I remember our waitress during restaurant week actually giving us advice on what the most cost effective deals were. 

Food: I am a huge fan of their rolls -- they are always very unique, with some rolls including ingredients like jalapenos in them or even the standard components such as soft shell crab. Whatever ingredients they put in their rolls, they are always of the highest quality. Aside from rolls, some of my favorite dishes include the Wagyu tenderloin (melt in your mouth beef that is packed with flavor) and the Walu fish sashimi (also a melt in your mouth white fish). Definitely visit during restaurant week -- they have an awesome value deal that allows you to try many dishes for a much cheaper price, and you definitely leave feeling very full!

My boyfriend and his family are regulars here. He took me for the first time when I visited him in Charlottesville. Coming from the SF Bay Area where I eat tons of sushi, this was one of the best I've had. 

The lobster tempura was INCREDIBLE. SO DELICIOUS I'M TEARING UP THINKING ABOUT IT. Even though everything wasn't 5-star perfect this tempura impelled me to give Ten a full five star rating. It was THAT good.  

The rock shrimp tempura was also good but a little too heavy. 


We got the tempura shrimp sushi rolls and the crab rolls. The crab rolls were spectacular. Tasted like mini crab cakes. The shrimp tempura was again a little too heavy with the sauce. 

We got edamame for appetizer. Very good. 
The seaweed salad was also SO DELICIOUS. second favorite thing of the night after lobster tempura. Red miso s

The green tea had a very unique earthy taste that I really enjoyed.

In a sense, it's not their fault, theres only so much Charlottesville restaurants can do not being immediately connected to any big cities receiving fish imports. For their means, they do a great job, the tuna always tastes fine, but I've had some others that have been chewy or fishy. They are also rather expensive because they do do the best they can to bring in fish.

33,2018-07-15,3.0,"My first restaurant in Charlottesville!! Aaaand it was just OK haha. The ambiance is lovely; really clean and modern, with high ceilings and windows. Bathrooms are nice too, which is always a big plus. 

The food I wouldn't go out of my way to come back for. Overall, everything was mediocre, and a couple dishes had added flavors that I did not care for. We ordered three courses from the Restaurant Week menu, those being the unagi don, torotaki, and shrimp rock tempura. The unagi don was definitely the worst thing we ordered; you don't really need to add much to sushi rice and well-cooked, good-quality unagi. But for some reason... they found the need to add a sort of ume seasoning in the form of furikake. It was weird. Like, the rice and thus the dish overall took on a sourer flavor that overpowered the normally fabulous, sweet taste of unagi. So that was mildly upsetting. The rock shrimp was certainly unique; it looks like tater tots, and the breading is thinner and softer. I personally prefer that, as there's more room for the actual shrimp. The torotaki was fine -- six pieces -- and tasted simple and relatively fresh. Can't say that the toro tasted special or far better than regular tuna, which is usually what I look for when I order toro. 

We also ordered three rolls -- the blue crab, the sake, and the rainbow -- and the Ten salad. The Ten salad combined some very strange vegetables, and overall I don't think they were very fresh, as some of the lettuce was way too bitter. The rolls had way too much mayo dolloped on top, which is a signal (to me) of over-Americanization of fresh, Japanese flavors that ought to be allowed to shine through on their own without being totally smothered by sauce. I also think the presentation was lacking... especially taking the classy ambiance into consideration. It was a tad messy. 

LASTLY, the wasabi was SO dulled down, and it was a weird color. And there was very little of it. 

Overall a totally lackluster experience -- though I am quite particular when it comes to Japanese food. I love the atmosphere and would maybe come back for just drinks, but no way would I recommend the place on the merit of their food alone.",42.0,Ten Sushi,0.9895,Sunday
34,2018-07-27,5.0,"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing atmosphere and location. 

My group came in not knowing anything -- our waitress ran us through everything,  and was incredibly pleasant to boot. We ended up going with the honey roll, the sake roll, and the wagyu beef roll, with an udon appetizer. All of our food came very promptly despite it being decently busy.

The udon came out very heavy on the salt, but the waitress provided us with hot water to dilute it almost immediately. All of the sushi was fantastic, we demolished it. Wrapped up with a triple sake tasting. I asked the bartender about sake, as I'm planning on visiting Japan this year, and he gave me an entire masterclass session about the sake brewing process, the terminology of each type of sake, and his own recommendations based on the preferences I listed. The sakes were all very interesting; worth trying even if you don't end up loving sake.

To top it all off, Ten is located right on the Downtown Mall in a well-decorated, cozy, and modern-feeling space. While it was a bit expensive (right around $70 including tax), I think it was more than worth it for the experience.

Went to Ten for a date night on Friday night and scored a table without a reservation. Although the downtown mall was hopping, I think Ten gets overlooked because it is upstairs.

We had a great waitress and excellent service throughout the night. We came for a sushi night, but specifically because they had numerous vegetarian options. Everything was great - we got veggie tempura, avocado tempura, avocado roll, cucumber roll, and the two other vegetarian rolls (a shitake mushroom based one, and a cucumber/avocado roll with plum sauce). The plum sauce was really floral and unique. We sprung for green tea mochi for desert - it wasn't for us (first time trying it), but I think it was a good version of mochi!

My personal favorites are the rock shrimp, soft shell crab roll, and Wagyu beef roll. The rock shrimp comes in two different sauces and they are both very flavorful. The soft shell crab roll is also really crispy and pretty large in size. The Wagyu beef roll has a soft texture to it and has good seasoning. The drink menu is also pretty decent. It's definitely quality over quantity here but the experience is worth it imo. The atmosphere gives me lowkey NYC vibes. It's romantic and it's perfect for date night or a girls night out. It does get a little dark though, especially if you're eating later in the day.

We ordered the
1.)Aka Dashi Miso (Red miso, tofu, nameko mushroom, and scallion) this was very good but a little salty for our taste
2.)Maguro Karai Honey Roll(tuna, scallion, spicy honey sauce) delicious!
3.)Spicy Toro Roll(chu toro, avo, pickled jalapeno, crunch, spicy sauces, tobiko.) This wasn't too spicy but had a good bite to it.
4.)Dragon Roll (fresh water eel, tamago, avocado, shisho) had avocado on top and had a drizzle of sauce over it which was sweet and made it all come together.
5.)Shitake Roll- This was very flavorful
All rolls came with Wasabi that was packed full of flavor and spice. Best Wasabi I've ever tasted!

Drink Recommendations:
We have never tried Sake before but tried the

Sake Flight: House Flight. ""Living Jewel"" ""Water Flower"" ""Soaring Clouds"". This was delicious and would recommend anyone try this!

Martinis:
-Bee's Knees (Chamomile infused gin, honey, lemon) This was light but had the punch of the gin and bitterness from the lemon. SO good. This was our favorite

-Ten Martini (tito's sake, aloe) This was very light but so refreshing!",9.0,Ten Sushi,0.9942,Tuesday

The tempura lobster and rock shrimp are out of this world.  I was pretty much full after those.  The portions are good for sharing.  My husband has the rainbow roll and the kani roll and said both were delicious.  We also got the harmari trio.  The meat was a little chewy but the flavors were good. I also ordered the Ten salad and could have done without it.  It's huge. I did not like it.  The lettuce is fresh but it's heavy on something that just was overpowering in taste.  I don't know if it was mint or some kind of herb but I couldn't eat it.  The pineapple martini was good.  I also had a dirty martini that was good. Husband had Jack and coke.  No complaints.  

The bathrooms are down a dark hallway and I mean dark.  If you have vision problems bring a flashlight. There's a staircase off to the side that's hard to see and I could see someone accidentally falling down if they turned the wrong way.

74,2021-10-13,3.0,"Ten would have simply been an overpriced Jap food place had I not the expectation that I could find some decent sushi here. Their idea of a 20-piece omakase is a 10-piece assortment but you get two of each instead of just one, and all of which were served in a huge plate at once. By the end everything was already cold (and they weren't particularly warm to begin with). The dim light didn't help, either. Later, I asked for a tamago sushi to finish off my meal, and the tamago was ice-cold and that's how you can tell that they are really using the same frozen stuff you'd find in the sushi section in a grocery store, makes one wonder if the same goes for other things in their menu. 
The one redeeming factor was that the service was pretty good. My waitress was really sweet and made sure I had everything I needed, but the food was, for the most part, a disaster, and no amount of good service can really make up for that.",2.0,Ten Sushi,0.8504,Wednesday

During the holiday season they are offering a holiday drink specialty cocktails which seemed to be an popular request of the night. 

Unfortunately, they were out of the rock shrimp tempura and hotate roll, which were both dishes I was eager to try. Must have been popular dishes so I want to go again and see what they are all about. That didn't prevent me from enjoying my meal however. 

I went ahead and ordered my udon soup, warm with a savory Japanese soy broth, and lobster tempura, covered in a sweet aioli, for my starters. For my main I ordered the soft shell crab roll which was very distinct in that I had never tried anything like it before. It's a warm roll that is served in 4 pieces. I believe the shiso, a Japanese herb, is what granted its refreshing flavor. The other roll I ordered was the tiger roll.

ELEGANCE.

Imagine walking up a flight of styled stairs that lead to a dim-lighted restaurant with a sushi bar, exposing all their fresh products. Royalty, much? 

FRESHNESS.

We ordered their toro sashimi and it MELTED into your mouth. Literally the best! We then ordered several rolls: Maguro Karai honey, Ebi tempura, Stella blue crab, Wagyu beef, Rainbow, Dragon, Negi Toro. My all-time favorites I highly-suggest you to order is the Negi Toro and Wagyu Beef. If you are a sPiCy person, Maguro Karai honey will do you some justice too! My least favorite was the dragon roll as it had an odd texture. 

We also tried their lychee martini which was a perfect blend of sweetness and bitter. I do typically order this in any Japanese restaurant because I love lychee and fish combos; although, Ten had the best by-far. Normally, the bartender makes the drink TOO sweet but this person did it perfectly right.

It was so refreshing cucumber vodka drink. Great way to start of the palate. I then ordered the lobster roll which did not disappoint. It's not what I was expecting at first but as soon as the first bite hit my mouth I was sold. It has such a sweet and spicy taste to it. The lobster was amazing in itself. I then ordered the wagyu beef roll. Again not know what to expect but the flavors of the marinade are perfect. The beef just almost dissolves on in your mouth. The avocado and lettuce in the roll topped with the beef was exactly what I needed and didn't know it. I was seriously having an orgasm  in my mouth. I know most people would not even consider this sushi but in my book it is. I def want to come back and try more.

The atmosphere is very cool. High end vibe for sure. Service was great. Good sake selection. 

Felt like it was going to be a great night when we sat down and started looking over the menu. 

Unfortunately the sushi itself did not live up to the promise of the restaurant design. 

It is simply not good. It's not awful. I've had worse, but nowhere near the level of what good sushi should taste like. 

The Toro tasted old and it was room temperature. Yuck. Other rolls had that ""fishy"" taste that signals the fish is too old or has not been cared for properly in the case. 

Should have seen this coming as I saw other rolls they were placing on the counter get hot beef dumped on top of them. That's a big red flag that this is more about the idea of cool sushi and not delivering actual high quality sushi.

The restaurant wasn't particularly crowded when we got there (~6:30) but definitely filled up by the time we left (~8:30). The server took a few minutes to get to us but promptly took our drink order, but that's where the promptness ended. It took about 20 minutes to get our first drinks. I ordered a sake flight and my husband ordered a beer. We also ordered some edamame. All three came out around the same time. The server came by to check on us and noticed we were low on water. He promised to refill but seemingly forgot, but came back to take our order. They were out of some of the non-sushi options we wanted to try so we decided to just do three sushi rolls: rainbow,sake, and tuna avocado. The server offered my husband another drink it was brought out before our food. When that came out I asked for a glass of sparkling wine. Our food came, we ate it, and 40 minutes later I still didn't have any sparkling wine. It was finally brought just before dessert. The server did take it off the bill, which was kind. But going the entire meal without a drink OR even water was kind of crazy for a place as high priced as Ten. They did give me a great dessert for my birthday which I appreciated but at that point the experience had been a little soured.  The sushi was decent, but not so amazing to overcome the poor service experience. I know everyone in the service industry is understaffed, but please at the very least bring me water! We probably would have ordered more if not for knowing it might take another 45 minutes to get more food or drinks.

The ambiance was amazing, the drinks were strong and delicious, and the food was absolutely mouth watering. They operate in a small plates/ tapas style, so you can place orders at any time and they come out as soon as they are ready. We started with the Tori trio, which was three chicken skewers charred to perfection, topped with unique sauces. My favorite was the spicy honey, which was sweet with just a small kick of heat at the end of the bite. Next, we tried a few rolls: the Ebi Tempura, the Japanese Wagu Beef, and the Soft Shell Crab. All three were delicious, but I recommend the soft shell crab roll the most: the crab was crunchy and super fresh. You also have to try the Wagu Beef in some form. They serve it many ways, but it was super rich, tender, and covered in a delicious teriyaki sauce. Next, we ordered the Ten Hamachi. If you order anything here, order this. The yellowtail absolutely melts in your mouth, and is accompanied by a luxurious ponzu butter sauce. I also tried the Lychee martini, which was a delicious (very strong) play on a bar classic. Last, we got the green tea mochi for dessert. The ice cream was silky, and so addictive. Overall, this was a phenomenal experience.

We arrived on time for our reservation. Upon arrival, the hostess informed us that our table was not available yet, and every table was occupied. So, we waited.

And whenever new diners would come in, she would have to stop this process to greet them. At this point, there were multiple parties standing and waiting. So after almost 30 minutes, she was able to walk us to our table. We were starving by this point, and it took almost 15 minutes to be greeted by our server. Then, our drinks took over 20 minutes to arrive.

Now for the not so good: the harami was very disappointing--it was so chewy it was difficult to eat. It might have been overcooked or just a very poor cut of meat. Either way, it was unpleasant. Finally, the ten (their signature salad) was simply gross. The greens were wilting and some had actually turned bad. We were baffled how they could serve this.

Tastes like any other eel roll I've ever had. The hamachi with ponzu butter? You can only taste butter and no other flavors (including the fish). So, mediocre food. Service was pleasant but SLOOOOOW. Waited 15 minutes for drinks, had to chase someone down for the check. One of the chefs had a shirt on that said ""I hate it here.""

Ten is generous with size of the fish for the omakase compared to other omakase places that I have visited and the various fish that we did sample tasted fresh and buttery. We also tried the Japanese Wagyu beef roll which was alright but I don't think I would get it again. The wagyu was soft and rich but the experience eating it reminded me of a teriyaki rice bowl, I think I just prefer getting fish with my sushi and rolls. Additionally, the wagyu roll was rolled poorly and would break apart immediately when we tried to pick the pieces up with our chopsticks which made it hard to experience the flavors from the roll and the beef together. The Hotate roll was much better and rolled properly. Their lychee martini is definitely on the stronger end.

And even on the 'cheaper' dishes, they do not skimp out on the portions such as the tempura lobster and cuttlefish. The sashimi was exciting because we didn't know what we were getting but knew it was going to be delicious. It was fresh, flavorful, and gave us an opportunity to taste many different pieces that I wouldn't have ordered otherwise. My absolute favorite dish were the scallops; I had never tasted scallops like those before. You just have to go try it out and treat yourself!",229.0,Ten Sushi,0.992,Thursday

We each got a sake flight, both of which had three delicious sake tastings. We ended up deciding to do a follow-up glass of the Yoshi No Gawa. Finally, we had four rolls-the Spicy Toro, the Stella Blue Crab Roll, the Wasabi Roll, and the Negi Toro. Favorites were definitely the Spicy Toro (truly just amazing, not too spicy but so flavorful) and the Stella Blue Crab Roll (a very unique, but very Virginian, sushi roll).

I MIGHT have forgiven this if the food was good, but no such luck. The special ""bathed overnight in marinade then kissed with a torch"" miso sea bass was overdone to the point of being rubbery, and took twice as long as promised.

After you've gone up, you'll be greeted into a very dimly lit & ambiance more like that of a chic bar in NYC, not what you'd expect of a Japanese sushi restaurant.  The bar area was the most impressive feature about this place.  I could barely read the menu as it was so dark (always makes me feel suspicious of restaurants that are so dimly lit).  Server was friendly.  Ordered green salad & seaweed salad both were good but sushi rolls were like the ones you'd get from a grocery store, just nicely plated.

They ran out of another flight so we got this one instead. Out of the three, our favorite was the okunomatsu. It was the lightest smoothest one on the palette. For an appetizer we got the aburi saba because we love mackerel and it was delicious! There were some seaweed it seemed like at the bottom and it really made the dish. We also got the negi toro and that was my least favorite. I wanted to have toro so thought it would be nice to get an additional piece of it but I didn't know it would be minced toro. Compared to the other dishes, it wasn't that special and I don't think I will order it again because it was kind of lacking but it was a nice change in flavor since it has seaweed. 
The main star of the show was the omakase 20 piece sashimi. It was very filling and every single piece of fish was quality. It tasted very fresh and they all had different distinct mouthfeels so it was such a wonderful tasting experience trying all the different pieces. We also ordered an additional piece of uni because it was a special occasion. We had originally ordered 2 pieces but they were running out and so we got the last piece. We love this place since we're both sushi lovers and would definitely recommend if celebrating a special occasion.

It's kind of sad and pathetic when you wait a few hours anticipating to order online at 5pm (opening time), but online orders via their website for any of their items say ""not available"" or ""ordering online is currently disabled. Please contact the restaurant to place the order"" and when you do, they drop your call and take 6 calls before they answer. The host said verbatim ""Sometimes we do takeout but not tonight because we are busy"". This person did not know why there is no consistency in online orders as to when it's available or when it's posted as unavailable, when asked. The answer is *never* based on looking at their social media. 

Please do not consider yourself a ""modern Japanese cuisine"" that prides themselves on being a landlocked sushi restaurants that curates fresh fish from the coast if you cannot provide your consumers the courtesy or notice that there is no online orders in advance. 

I completely that your establishment may be fully booked, but when someone as myself who usually ventures to this establishment *in person* cannot, and when my wife asks for quality sushi and she just delivered a baby but she gets disappointed, it's a shame. While this may be a one time thing for us, you just really need to do better communicating that there are no online orders before the restaurant opens. Period. This is a new experience I have learned about this establishment, and it sucks.

121,2013-10-07,5.0,"On only my second visit to the University of Virginia's campus I had an expectation of finding that special UVA haunt where all the college students and professors alike can hang out and share stories over a cold brew.  Not just any place mind you, the atmosphere needed to be unique, cozy and that vibe... well you would only know it when it occurred.  Eureka!!! this is indeed the place and I would recommend The Virginian Restaurant all day long for those wanting the same type of experience.

The wait on a Friday evening was not long, but keep in mind there is not a lot of room to wait.  The manager quickly took my name and gave expectations of a estimated wait time.  There is one bench toward the entrance of the place.  Outdoor seating is also available and awesome for nice weather and being among all the foot traffic. All the tables were wooden booths and bar seating was available too. Not a lot of room in the walk way beside the tables, so keep this in mind if you have any issue with being too cozy.  I LOVED the fact it was this way and it added to the mystique of the place. The restaurant was clean and tables were quickly being bused for patrons waiting.

After about 10 minutes we got a table and a waitress who was new had menus and got drink orders. TV's were all around us for your viewing pleasure. However, I really enjoyed the people watching as we were set by the bar. Our table had chunks of wood chipped out from rowdy college students I suppose. I assume many were this way and I just thought it added to the overall charm of the place. How old were these tables any way... well the restaurant itself it a landmark on campus. Are they original to the 1940's, I am unsure. But the wooden floors, booths and bar was like being in a tavern in old time Williamsburg.

We put in our order, for my son's chicken fingers and my Coal Miner Burger. I also ordered a Pint of Full Nelson Pale Ale during happy hour for a measly $2, which was delicious. Even though our waitress was new she smiled often and was helpful every step of the way. The place was slammed, but you would not have known by her attitude. It did not take anymore than 15 minutes and food was out. We both enjoyed our meals and I was in aw of the taste and price of my burger for $9. The Coal Miner is a 1/2 pounder with bacon and barbecue. It comes with fries too. My son's four large chicken fingers were more than he could handle and they really piled on the fries.  

We struck up a conversation with a couple at the bar about the UVA Football the next day. Yes, you are that close even if seated at a table. They were from Indiana and I too am a native Hooiser. We both had the same thoughts of the restaurant. This is the place if your wanting a nostalgic venue for the many a student who have passed through the front door of The Virginian before you.

Eateries like this are a treasure to find. Engagements occur here regularly, secret societies on campus have activity here, and regular folks like me just breathe this all this in.

It's like 3 pieces of bread with what seems to be endless pieces of turkey, ham, bacon, tomato, lettuce in between... You get to pick a side too (French fries for me). With the amount of food that I got, it felt like I ate enough to last the entire day. Definitely a place with the largest portions I've been to. Come hungry I suppose! 

2) Some sort of salmon burger, which I do not see on their menu anymore. I would not recommend this. I love salmon and thought this was going to be delectable and amazing... WHAT a disappointment..

Waitstaff seemed disorganized which was bad in a space that was already so cramped. It took a while for us to get  menus and drinks but once our food orders went in the food came pretty quickly. I had a grilled cheese sandwich (there weren't a ton of non-meat options) with tomato and as simple as that is, it was a really good grilled cheese. My stepdad had a steak omelette and said it was good. 

From one college town to another, I feel like every campus has at least one restaurant like this where it's a campus 'tradition' or someplace you have to eat at because of the history or because everyone recommends it.

After the game, many of the undergrads told me to head to ""The Corner"" and experience ""UVA Life."" The majority of the people told me to check out The Virginian...or ""The Virg"" as they called it. What a good suggestion.

I stopped in and grabbed a booth and was immediately greeted by Erin, a vibrant, always-smiling 3rd year. She grabbed me a cold Get Bent IPA and suggested several items off the menu. ""We're known for our Mac & Cheese but I love our Coal Miner burger. The Caesar Wrap is good too.""

After choosing the Coal Miner burger, I sat back and enjoyed my beer while watching the undergrads file in along with some other alums and basketball fans for a local bite before the kitchen closed at 10pm.

Hannah was the other server on tonight and she & Erin were a very impressive team. Hannah had a infectious smile and humble attitude that made you want to leave a bigger tip before she even did anything. They are both the epitome of ""good people"" and anyone who has a son in college at UVA is hoping they find a girl like them. Each of them stopped by my table numerous times to check on me and just chat. They answered my questions and shared stories about ""The Virg"" and their experiences on campus as undergrads and also gave me some ""must see"" sights while in town.

The burger was awesome and served exactly as ordered. The first bite was awesome as the bacon was crispy, the burger was juicy and the bbq sauce was Carolina Sweet. Add in the crispy seasoned fries and the Chris Stapleton songs on the speakers made the entire meals more enjoyable. 

Look, there are lots of places in this town you could eat but if you're looking for something other than a fast food burger or a assembly line burrito, do yourself a favor and enjoy the experience of The Virginian in CVille. Just be sure to ask ""are Erin and Hannah are working tonight."" If they are, grab a seat...and consider buying a lottery ticket because you just had some great luck come your way.

We ordered the grilled cheese, Virginian burger, and the southwest veggie wrap. I appreciated the addition of vegetarian items to the menu. Overall, the food was good and met my expectations. My dad (who ordered the burger) commented that his burger was very tasty. I ordered the southwest veggie wrap, which was also quite tasty, but was a little soggy due to the dressing/veggies. Based on my experience, I'd say go to the Virginian for a high quality burger. They're also known for having dope Mac' and cheese (although, I can't confirm since I didn't try it). 

This place is also great for not only happy hour, but also beer at any time of day. They have great drink specials always. When I was there they were having a 'two for five dollar' deal, which I found as a great deal for quality product.

The Virginian is a classic Corner restaurant that offers a variety of American foods with big portions at generous prices. They also offer fantastic drink specials after 7pm every day that I highly recommend checking out.

I came here with some friends looking to get a few drinks and ordered some appetizers. After taking a glance at the dinner menu, the crab cake entree caught my eye and I decided to turn a late afternoon casual visit into an early dinner. I was not disappointed.

All main entrees come with two sides, so my two large lump crab cakes came with a healthy handful of sweet potato fries and a ceramic cup full of mac n cheese, topped with a crispy hash brown. 

The crabcakes themselves were pretty good, though slightly softer and breadier than what I have had in the past. But at $22, I don't think I can expect a 95%+ crab meat serving. The sweet potato fries were hot, crisp, and lightly salted. The mac n cheese is a side the Virginian is famous for and there is an excellent reason for that. If it fits your diet, always select the mac n cheese as a side. 

All in all, the Virginian offers a wonderful casual dining experience at an affordable price with generous portions. If you're on the corner and looking for a wholesome place to grab a bite with some friends, the Virginian should always be a consideration.",13.0,Virginian,0.9916,Monday

I had the 'famous' mac & cheese as a appetizer. It was very very bland and made me ponder on what was so famous about it anyway???

For dinner, I had the crab cake sandwich. The bun seemed hard / old, the crabcake was properly cooked, but again very very bland. The arugula sauce did not have the kick that one would expect and did not add any enhancements to the flavor profile. With that being said, I had to share mine sauce with someone else at my table as they did not receive their container of arugula sauce with their cab cake sandwich. We would of asked for more but we had to ask for multiple other missing items beforehand, and it was few and far between when we saw our waitress.

For my sides I had fries which were not bad (maybe packaged season fries???)

My other side was french onion soup... I finally figured where they were storing all of their spices!!!!!! They should reconsider renaming this soup as salt onion soup. I LOVE french onion soup and order it almost every time I see it on menu. This is hands down the absolute worst french onion soup that I unfortunately have tried. All you could taste is salt... nothing else.. I could not finish it with fear of having a stroke, and it was just god awful bad.

Then after patiently waiting for our bill (once again feeling forgotten about by our waitress), we asked her to split the bill and kindly told her who had what (because she really did forget). Her world still seemed somewhat rocked having to do this.

She then came back with out respective bills and of course did not have it right. I ended up with all the appetizers. I ended up just paying for them all because I was beyond done with this place by then, and had places to go.

To my understanding this is Charlottesville's oldest restaurant. From older reviews that I read this seemed to once be upstanding place to eat at. I would imagine that either ownership has changed, management, cooking staff, and/or recipes/ingredients... Maybe all of above???

The fries were sub par (soft, undercooked) and the fish was crispy but the breading was too heavy. I do think this place is good for bar food, but not for a solid meal. The beers on tap were $4 during happy hour which was great. That being said, the mac and cheese did live up to the hype. It was quite good...cheesy...would order again.

139,2019-03-18,4.0,"We came to The Virginian on a Saturday for lunch. We were visiting the university and someone recommended us to go eat here. When we came maybe half of the restaurant was full. The hostess/server was very nice and sat us at a booth. My boyfriend got one of the local IPAs that was actually pretty good! For appetizer we got the spinach and artichoke with pita bread and it was really good! The dip was made in house and had a pretty decadent flavor. For our mains I got the grilled cheese sandwich with fries and my boyfriend got their Virginian burger. The sandwich was decent, but a little dry - nothing life changing. Fries were seasoned well. My boyfriend ordered his burger to be medium rare but it came out medium-well. He didn't complain as the burger as a whole was really good. 

I understand the restaurant is a bit of an institution around these parts so by that standard the place didn't really wow us. However, the drinks and food were a great deal for their prices. We ended up paying 33 dollars for a beer, an appetizer and 2 mains, which is so cheap!

The ribs were SO tender and really fantastic. You could barely touch them with your fork and the meat just falls off the bone leaving it flawlessly clean. Delicious!

The mac-n-cheese, which this place is apparently known for, was really underwhelming. It was creamy, but it had almost no flavor. Just tasted like a bowl of creamy noodles, lacking cheesy flavor/boldness, and also didn't have enough salt. The potato cake fritter thing on top was dense and also flavorless - ours tasted overcooked or perhaps not fresh. 
The sweet potato fries were meh. 
The French onion soup wasn't super hot and was just OK. 

So...why four stars if we didn't love the food that much? COOL atmosphere, a true college town establishment with a lot of history and a great vibe, friendly people (both staff and patrons - we made so many friends just sitting there for dinner!), great conversations, and a really fun night.

I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken with Fries and Mac n' Cheese. The chicken was neither super crispy outside or juicy inside and there's definitely much better fried chicken in Charlottesville for less. The Mac n' Cheese was overcooked and didn't have a nice bite to it, but the cheese sauce, fries, and potato cake were decent. The fries tasted like Red Robin fries.

We also ordered The Chicken Tenders and Chicken Philly. Both dishes were mediocre. Definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here and order them because they tasted like average chicken tenders and chicken philly sandwiches that you could get from any run-of-the-mill fast-food place.

168,2022-01-28,2.0,"Overall quite disappointed, as I was visiting Charlottesville from Baltimore and this restaurant was on my ""to-do"" list.

In hindsight, I should have known better than to order crab cakes... I wonder if people outside of the Chesapeake know what a crab cake is supposed to be?  Crab cakes are shaped like mounds, with discernable - preferably large - chunks of crab inside, off-white in color.  What I received was as if someone thought a crab cake was a hamburger patty made of crab - ground up crab meat (I'll assume it was crab, though I saw nothing that would resemble a lump of crab), flat like a burger of ground meat, gray in color (I have no idea how this even comes to be), slightly charred, and bland.  This is not a crab cake.   This is reconstituted pureed crab.

Moving on, the french onion soup was passable, would have been better with an ample amount of cheese, as it had a deli slice of swiss thrown on top.

Mac & Cheese was fine, not sure why it is famous, and I didn't read the menu carefully enough to know that it was topped with a ""house-made cheddar potato cake.""  At first glance I saw it and thought it was a fried green tomato, but sadly it was not.  I'm not mad at the potato cake, but it did nothing to enhance the mac & cheese, and was like a carb overload.  

On the plus side, service was polite, the atmosphere was buzzing, and ...well... that's it.

Last but not least, when you calculate tip, it should be on pre-tax dollars.  Including the tax in the tip in your suggested tip is dishonest and anyone who doesn't check your math is being ripped off.  

Wouldn't return, but if I did I would not even consider the ""crab cakes.""",501.0,Virginian,-0.855,Friday

The meal also went well with a side of their crispy fries. The Famous Spinach & Artichoke Dip is rich and creamy and is perfectly coupled with their house made tortilla chips. My favorite part of the Stumble Down Mac N' Cheese is the jalapeños pepper Jack cheese sauce and the potato pie laid on top of the mac. All together it's a filling and delicious meal! 

Pro tip: if you're looking for a quick for filling snack, get the appetizer sized Stumble Down Mac N' Cheese!

The Virginian is about what you'd expect for a university-proximate eatery--good beer, fries, and all sorts of other food that probably serves if you eat meat (I don't, but the fries are good). 

The staff set it apart. Every time I've come, Brooke has been friendly, attentive, and found me a seat and a cold drink with alacrity. Alona is charming and stopped by regularly enough to make sure I didn't stay thirsty. They've both recommended good draft beers, cracked a couple of jokes, and made me feel welcome.

For a place that has the INSANE amount of hype the Virginian has it is so abysmally bad.

No flavor to be found. I felt like I was eating overdone pasta sitting in a cup of milk. So disgusting. I asked my friend if she REALLY liked it and she goes ""well.... Okay it's not great but it's the Virginian! What do you expect!!""

That should tell you all you need to know. People hype it up because it's a more ""exclusive bar"" on the corner (aka hires a bouncer that actually rejects fake IDs) but if you're sober I wouldn't eat here.

We've walked by the Virginian numerous times now and always see how it is a long time uVa institution since 1923. Ok let's give it a try. It's your typical college dive bar offering drinks and bar food. Prices are pretty reasonable compared to Nova but, yeah, not much to write home about. 

Servers all seem to be young UVa students which is a good thing. They are friendly and attentive. 

On to the food...we ordered the following-
-grilled chicken salad
-steak and cheese w/fries
-crabcake sandwich with side salad & mac & cheese
-french onion soup

Portions are pretty big except for the steak and cheese. That was on the smaller side. 

Crabcake is ok...not packed with crab, lots of filler...meh

Salad is decent.

I heard from a little birdie the burger was quite good so that would likely be my next option. Fries were spectacular though. An incredible amount of seasoning was added... which always gets bonus points for me.

241,2008-06-12,1.0,"Eh?

I went to college in Charlottesville, VA.  Now, we like to eat down in cville.  I was back in town for a wedding and the rehearsal dinner was there.  
Let me start with the good stuff.  
-Service: They have good service.  They cleared plates and filled drinks fast. They were attentive but not overly hovering.  We had a big group of people but the food came out fairly quick. 
-Cost: Eh.   a little more pricier than most. But, not bad. I'm not sure how much the food actually lives up the place though.

Oh.. wait i'm already going into the bad stuff:
-Food: Dude, seriously the most important thing.  I ordered... Piccata di Pollo con Limone.. aka. Chicken Piccata. It comes with spaghetti in a similar sauce. Honestly, the chicken part of the dish was really good. However... God, I hate spaghetti.  It tasted like plain spaghetti.   Vitello alla Parmigiana  aka Veal Parmagean.... ditto. meat good. bad pasta.  

The salads were okay. You really have to be stupid to mess up salad. 
The ice-cream dessert was okay. Ditto on the stupid thing.
The appetizers... calamari was good. Not overly greasy.  And the bruschetta appetizer was pretty good as well.  

I feel... they fall short.  They have a decent atmosphere... you can watch movies outside and eat dinner, good tablescape and dishes, etc.  The bathroom was so hot, I don't know why they don't have ac in there.  

But, yes.. back to the food. I feel like I'm avoiding it.  

Here's the gist:

If you are a poor college student or your car breaks down in front of the restaurant... then you can go.  If not... go anywhere else. Go downtown ... it's only a few minutes away.  Honestly... I'm a little unimpressed.  apathetic, really.... kind of place where you don't take the leftovers home, but leave it there.

From the road, you would not expect Vivace to sprawl as much as it does, but there are plenty of outdoor tables which make Vivace an excellent dining choice during the pandemic. We ordered the artichoke and goat cheese dip, orecchiette, and a spaghetti dish with clams that I could not find on the online menu. Shortly after we arrived, warm bread was brought out with individual salt and pepper packets, a small bowl of olive oil, and a small bowl of Parmesan cheese. The artichoke dip was served piping hot and was quite tasty if a little too salty for my taste. Our entrees were served in massive portions and we were only able to eat half of our respective dishes. The clams were fresh and the rest of the dish was quite acceptable. The sauce of orecchiette was somewhat watery and bland, but the pasta itself was cooked perfectly and fresh basil was delectable.

The bruschetta was classic and simple, yet tasty- it came with mozzarella cheese melted in between the toast and tomato. The calamari was also crunchy and tender, the fried peppers tossed in were a nice touch- just wish there were some tentacles mixed in with the rings! For dinner, we shared the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the orecchiette pasta.

We have done taken out from Vivace several times during Covid, and visited a couple of months ago and ate outside. This time we decided to eat inside and everything was great. Recognized our reservation, sat us immediately, and the service was all that you would expect and require.  Food was excellent and the timing of appetizers and the meal was good, especially since we knew that it is important for them to turn tables since we are still at 50% capacity.  

Only negative is parking.  I had to circle twice before I parked in a really tight spot on a hill.  On one side UVA is putting up a new building so there is a chain link fence that limits parking, and on the other side there is a strip of stores and since it was a Sunday we thought we could park in the empty lot. However, they had a part-time security guard who politely told us this was off-limits. Seems the ownership of the strip mall is not very supportive of Vivace.  We did find a spot, but when it gets back to 100% capacity I can imagine that parking is going to be a big problem for them.

We ordered three entrees, the gnocchi, carbonara, and the pizza margherita. The pizza was the best of our entrees, it had a great crisp and char that tasted really authentic, if we come back that'll definitely be ordered again. The gnocchi was solid but not excellent, the spinach cream sauce was a very liquid-y cream sauce with some cooked spinach in it. The carbonara had the same problem of very liquid-y sauce. The pastas still tasted pretty good, just weren't the texture we were expecting from the descriptions in the menu. 

The staff was not particularly kind to us when we entered, we asked for a table for three and the staff asked us to wait a moment (which is more than fine), and while we waited they talked amongst themselves. We tried a few times to ask quick questions and were ignored and eventually told to seat ourselves. After we sat down most of the staff sat at the bar and we were able to hear them speaking negatively about customers who had just left the restaurant, which created an uncomfortable atmosphere.

We ordered the calamari as an app ($12) and the orecchiette ($22) as my entree. The sauce was packed with the savory house made sausage and broccoli rabe. It was so delicious, full of umami and the serving was quite large. The sauce filled up the little pockets in the pasta and the ratio of sauce to carb, was perfect for me.

I think I've found one of my new favorite places, so thank you so much for the recommendation! The food was delicious and well priced. Not overly expensive for a nice meal, great ingredients and the service was really good, our waitress was knowledgeable and really made a positive difference.

We sat on the upper patio, but next time we go, we will request the bistro seating which is outdoors and near a large willow tree. I recommend you ask for the table under the willow tree if you have enough time to make a reservation!

I am new to Cville, and Vivace had been my favorite place in the few weeks I have lived here. Tonight, I went after work, after a very long day, looking for good comfort Italian food. I was so looking forward to a relaxing, delicious meal. So, there was no question where I was heading tonight. Vivace! From the moment I sat down, however, the service was pathetic. The servers brought me bread and olive oil -- but no plate on which to eat it. My salad was delicious -- but no one came to clear my plate, even as I watched a nearby table of five being treated like royalty. I waved my hand for five minutes to get someone to take my dinner order. Finally, dinner came, and it was delicious. But I sat there afterward for 25 minutes with no one to refresh my water, take my accumulating plates or to give me my check! I My Uber arrived 15 minutes after I had finished my meal -- but NO CHECK. I was tempted to leave without paying but knew that was not right, so I took my credit card to the cashier and asked if I could pls pay before my Uber drover away. The server took my card, came out with a receipt, but not ONE WORD of apology. I felt angry and asked to see a manager...and then felt even angrier. I interrupted a conversation the owner was having at the bar, and apparently he was too enthralled to be concerned with the issues of an older woman at who had just spent $50 at his restaurant. When I mentioned to him what had happened, he said he already had spoken to the server. But again, not one apologetic word! As a business woman, I travel frequently, and it is not unusual at all for me to dine alone. In most cities and in most places, I am treated with courtesy because I am spending money at dining establishments. Vivace, however, acted like I was invisible. An older women dining alone -- who is she, anyway? The owner's attitude was even more disagreeable than the server's -- he could have at least apologized. Because he did not, I will not be back. I do not do business with people who do not treat people with courtesy -- especially when we are paying for it.  It is sexist and ageist to treat a paying female customer with such discourtesy. I felt like I was living in the 1800s. A simple ""I'm sorry"" was all it would have taken make the night right. That that did not happen signifies a disrespect and disdain for older women and demonstrates to me that this place is, sadly, a throwback to previous generations when such disrespect and hostility were mainstream. I guess I should be happy they didn't ask me to wash the dishes.",11.0,Vivace,0.2936,Thursday
286,2021-11-11,3.0,"I'd heard only good things about Vivace after living in Charlottesville for a few years, but I didn't hear about it often. We decided it would be a fun stop for a mid-week date night to try something new. We got bread for the table, bruschetta ($10) and the sausage & crispy polenta ($12) appetizers. The bruschetta comes with melted mozzarella, tomato, onions, and balsamic. The sausage and polenta comes with 2 full sausage links in a red sauce with peppers and onions on top of a square of polenta. The polenta was tasteless.

For entrees I got the orecchiette with sausage, broccoli rabe, tomato, and grana padano ($22). The sauce was so thin I couldn't pick any of it up with my fork (no spoon provided), and there was no grana padano cheese. It's more of a soup in this way. My partner got the carbonara ($19), which he said was very bland.

The best part of the meal was the warm bread and olive oil. It was truly a nice olive oil, and the bread was flaky and delicious with it. No complaints about service, but for the price of this Italian food, I would recommend you go to Tavola instead.",8.0,Vivace,0.9721,Thursday
287,2021-12-18,3.0,"Nice Staff and Decor, Mediocre Food and Long Wait

After several years of living in Charlottesville, I finally took a trip over to the famed Vivace. I had heard so much about this apparent staple of Charlottesville Italian food and I had put off trying this restaurant due to not having a ""valid enough"" reason for visiting the restaurant. My sister's graduation celebration demanded a visit, so I finally had an opportunity to visit it. 

Walking up to Vivace, it becomes apparent that the outdoor section of the restaurant is gorgeous; especially at night. The string lights and ambience alongside the UVA road is alluring, and had it not been the wintertime, I might have requested an outdoor table. They have heaters in appropriate places, so if you want to eat outside, it's still a realistic possibility. After being seated in an upstairs dining room that flooded my nostrils with nostalgia of my grandparents' attic, we were greeted by a nice waiter named Landry. This brings me to the best part of the meal: the service. Landry and the other servers were enthusiastic, knowledgeable about the food and drink options, and attentive almost to a fault! When you needed a drink refill, you got a drink refill. When you needed more fresh bread, you got fresh bread. 

Our appetizer was bruschetta. The dish was nicely complemented with fresh tomatoes and unrealistically delicious balsamic vinegar. A great start to a great evening. After our orders were placed, our experience soured. We waited for a minimum of 45 minutes for our food to be served. My friend pointed out that it had been at least an hour and that a party of 6 (2 less than our group) received their food and their bill even though they had arrived 15 minutes after us. Sure, the food had probably been made to order, but a 45-60 minute wait for food is an incredibly long amount of time. 

Eventually, the food came to the table. I received the Spaghetti and Meatballs; an Italian classic. The marinara sauce was uninspired. I tasted the food of my other family members. The food ranged from bland to pretty darn good. It's not bad, but there's certainly better Italian food in Charlottesville.

So would I revisit Vivace? If I had a friend ask me to join them in celebration at Vivace, the understandable prices, fantastic service, and decent decor wouldn't keep me from coming. But if you're looking for great Italian food, stick to Carmello's, Tavola, or Lampo.",188.0,Vivace,0.9963,Saturday

We were concerned about dining out during the most recent Covid spike, but the properly spaced tables and outside air coming in around the plastic sides put an end to our worry. It was a nice atmosphere.
  We started with the fried oyster appetizer which was on the specials menu. They were delicious! Very fresh with an excellent aoli alongside. Frankly the best we have had all year. The portion was very generous. 
  Next the wedge salad. Again delicious! The gorgonzola and pancetta were a perfect match.
  My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs which he said he enjoyed. I ordered the mussels with homemade tagliatelle pasta. Not something I normally order, but the fried oysters were so good I decided to keep with the seafood theme. The portion was huge with a generous amount of mussels. They were as fresh as the oysters. The tagliatelle was cooked perfectly. The sauce was just enough to allow the flavor of the mussels to shine. I brought most of my entree home, being full by then, and look forward to finishing it tonight!
   I really wanted to try the tiramisu but would have burst. Next time.

Management made no offer or effort to return my card. The next day when I came back into town to pick up my card, they did not say, ""We are sorry for the inconvenience"" or anything similar. They asked me for my ID, and gave me back my card.
My gripe is the indifference that management showed me to my situation. Clearly, they have enough customers so they did not feel compelled to offer to help me or at minimum apologize for making me drive 56 miles roundtrip for their mistake.

We both ordered cocktails that just tasted like liquor, they weren't stirred and you could tell by the separation of liquids. The food was mediocre at best. The risotto tasted like Lundberg's boxed Garlic Primavera risotto...like identical. The spinach cream sauce was a cream sauce with a handful of spinach added as an afterthought and uncooked, halved cherry tomatoes. It was just a really weird experience. Not to mention the dust. If you're going to have a ton of knick knacks floating around your restaurant, they should be dusted. If you have ever used a stove before, you could probably cook whatever we had for dinner last night - save yourself the money, stay at home and cook.",2.0,Vivace,0.9101,Saturday

It was not overpriced at all, compared to the other valentine's day up prices. The service was also great and the waiter was very friendly. We went to the upstairs seating and it was dimmed dark.

The mushrooms in this dish were huge and delightful. 

The service was a little odd. The server brought our entree and we had to ask for silverware when she was like ""Anything else you all need?"" She was nice and knew all the specials, so the service was overall pretty okay.

It's creamy, somewhat sweet, and the homemade pasta is perfection. I have told so many of my friends and family to order this when they've joined me for dinner, and no one has ever been disappointed.

They bring out fresh bread that we dipped in some olive oil, S&P, and balsamic (you gotta ask for that). we got the calamari for appetizer and that just missed the mark for me. The squid was excellent (soft and not chewy at all), but the breading was cornmeal which gave it a gritty texture. Now for the entrees, they were HUGE. The pasta vivace was addicting. It was on the sweeter side, but it had everything I wanted, chicken, tomatoes, a nice cream sauce. Chefs kiss. I did not get to try the veal parm but it was also a substantial size.

We then waited another 30 minutes for her to show up again and she apologized for forgetting about us, she was extremely high energy, acted high and very forgetful.

We shared a really good salad and bread, then ordered our entrees. My entree was delivered with the wrong sauce which the server recognized right away. She took it back to the kitchen. I was then given the correct entree but it was not good. It was like a bowl of creamy pesto sauce with pasta hidden beneath. I didn't complain because it was edible, just not what I expected.

341,2024-06-26,2.0,"Yeah vivace has kinda fallen downhill since the last time I was in and I probably wouldn't be back at this point. All of my coworkers and friends agree. It was good a few years ago but is nowhere near what it used to be. TLDR: expect really basic kinda boring Italian food for twice as much as you should pay.

First thing is the ambiance in here is great - the building is really cool and the decor inside is great. They have started storing extra kitchen boxes in the foyer, which was a little weird, but overall the ambiance is nice. This is probably the best part of the experience here.

Service wise, not so great. Most of the staff I saw were either high schoolers or early college and act aloof like they're too good to talk to you or act bothered that they have to do their job. Their foyer is basically an intersection with a ton of other paths and the servers/staff will literally run into you while you're waiting at the host stand. Overall really rude. Staff was also walking around in pairs/groups chatting and it felt like I was eating in a cliquey high school cafeteria lol. Top it off with our rude server who joked that he had to check IDs because we ""look like a bunch of babies in a trench coat"" (were all in our mid-late twenties) and then continued to just make backhanded jokes to us the rest of the evening? Yeah. Not great.

Then there's the food. The arancini we got was actually pretty solid. The entrees were not. My ravioli was bland at best, pretty much plain cheese ravioli with vodka sauce. My boyfriends chicken picatta was so boring. Plain breaded chicken with plain spaghetti in what tasted like just straight lemon juice. Ugh

Everyone else at our table said the fettuccini Alfredo and the pasta primavera were similarly boring and bland. This place used to be good but is now a robbery. They are audacious charging as much as they do for some of the most boring Italian I've ever had.

Overall with the combination of our awful service and terrible food we would not be back. Would not recommend you give it a try. Cville is full of great restaurants and this is no longer one of them.",249.0,Vivace,0.9967,Wednesday

344,2024-07-22,1.0,"I want to, first, make it very clear that our server, Linda, and every waiter/waitress we interacted with was fantastic. Almost every server that walked by took the time to stop and say hello to my well behaved golden retriever, Oatmeal. He was barking a tad at first, but a very nice blonde waitress came over and told us it was not an issue. Ever since the first time I visited, I loved Vivace (I even wrote a very positive review, see attached photos for proof); unfortunately, today I had a very negative experience and will no longer be a loyal customer nor will I ever recommend it as a place to visit again. We had a 6:30 reservation for two and a dog on the patio. We even noted in the reservation that our party included a dog. Oatmeal has sat on their patio multiple times without an issue, and tonight should have been no different. We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees, yet after sitting on the patio for about two hours a new group of guests chose to sit on the patio. We were sitting right by the entrance to the patio and the front door, meaning that any guest requesting to sit on the patio very clearly knew there was a dog on the patio. Oatmeal was well behaved, and left all other guests completely alone, except for when they would come up and ask to pet him. The problem is, and the part that makes me feel incredibly disrespected, that management approached us halfway through our entrees and told us that they had recieved complaints about my dog. Now, if my dog had behaved in any way problematically I would have agreed and left without a problem. My dog did not go up to other tables, nor did he try and steal any food that was not our own. When I was obviously taken aback by this statement I asked the manager to expand on what exactly was done wrong, and I was informed that ""maybe his tail is hitting people's chairs"", yet the flaw in this was that the only table anywhere near us was completely empty. Very clearly, the newer table was more ""valuable"" than us because my dog was nowhere near them, and even though we were there first and had reserved a table for the dog they just wanted to appease them regardless of how it affected us which was not a fair solution to the problem. I am absolutely disgusted with the way management chose to prioritize them over us, and I am heart broken that I can no longer go to one of my favorite restraunts in Charlottesville because of they way they handled the situation. I proceeded to ask the manager if we were being kicked out, and after dancing around the question for a few seconds it was evident that he expected us to leave, again even though we had reserved the table with the stipulation of having a dog; furthermore, we kept the dog in control and well behaved the entire time. My dog did absolutely nothing wrong, and I am confident that the new table chose to sit on the patio with the intention of kicking the dog out for whatever reason, believing they are more important and more worthy than us. We sat on the patio for two hours, and did not get to actually enjoy our entrees. I think a very clear solution would have been to offer them an inside table if they did not want to be on the same patio as a dog. I am very disappointed that what was supposed to be a fun night at a nice restraunt ended with me leaving early and in tears. Again, Linda was lovely and took very good care of us. If the dog had truly been a valid problem, I have a hard time believing that we would have been able to sit on the patio for about two hours before anyone had to say anything about the dog's behavior to us.",1.0,Vivace,0.9116,Monday

351,2024-09-30,5.0,"First off, let me start off by saying for all the haters out there let's first not forget that Italian cuisine is a celebration of the triumph. The struggles that the Italian people went through over the last few hundred years. And who knows who is Italian or not half the people in Richmond Virginia that people think are black or actually Cherokee Indian but that's neither here nor there there's so many critics that shouldn't be critics because first you shouldn't be allowed to judge food with a condescending tone about any of the aspects of it unless you yourself can replicate it at at least the level that you are criticizing or better, it takes a lifetime just about to be able to do that and I'm not talking about eating at Olive Garden A lot of these things seem like personal stabs at the business for something that oh gosh, I could only imagine I've been a line Cook sous chef for the better part of my life and their food is top-notch. It's in black-and-white on the menu. The portions were awesome and I like to eat a lot, and from the looks of the parking lot when I pulled in full of nothing but Aldi's and Porsches and a lot of other high-end vehicles that were the guest patron the place I'd say that there were some pretty experienced pallets there and I almost felt out of place in my Audi A5 Quattro picking up some pasta dishes and some desserts, but I was greeted with kindness may have took a little bit longer than I expected, but that's my expectation not the flow of the business and of course the people were probably young adults because that is one of the better jobs for them to get to give them some real world experience interacting with the public on many different levels the only way for a server to do exactly what the patron would like is a for them to act like a complete and total asshole at the beginning of the dinner by giving the waiter or waitress ridiculous instructions to follow the entire time they're at the table they have to be able to read your mind so cut them some slackbecause if something happens somewhere, it's usually never the waiters or waitresses fault unless they forget something or they're very unattended and that is the learning experience of that job I mean for crying out loud they get paid 213 an hour which barely covers their taxes. I challenge anybody to take on a 12 burner sauté a broiler oven a four-door refrigerator reach under 16 item sauté station bottom themselves. oh with a broiler and two sets of small grill racks for, different fish and what not and you have no time left go so mad respect to those who do that job because I know what it's like while you have condescending pretentious, entitled individuals overlooking the experience and only attacking what they are seeking if you like Italian food, even Gordon Ramsay palette would it would keep his mouth shut.

Eggplant Parm, Chicken Marsala (huge portion), and Bolognese were tasty and well prepared.  Wine list is somewhat short but adequate and fairly priced. Challenge was service. Was clear the restaurant was understaffed.  Wait for drinks extended to 20 minutes.  Wait for meals an additional 30 minutes after ordering. Even paying took about 20 minutes.

The bread was good and the white bean soup was fine (although I wish we were told there was meat in it). However, the marinara sauce was so acidic that it gave me the worst heartburn of my life, and my boyfriend said something tasted 'off' in the oricchiette dish. There was a bitter taste to it.

The biggest issue was that they need to clean their ice machine or wherever the ice is stored. The water tasted like it was going to make us sick. I'm not sure what happened! It wasn't like this a few months ago.",408.0,Vivace,0.3027,Friday

I had the chicken Parmesan, and my daughter had a small plate of fettuccine Alfredo and a Margherita pizza. All three entrées were cooked to perfection!

When better to stuff my face at places on my to go list than during Restaurant Week? C&O has been on my to go list of popular, high-rated dining experiences for a while now.

C&O is located at the end of the downtown mall a little past the Melting Pot in an antiquated building with what looks to be boarded up doors or windows or something in the front. When you enter, there is a small (by small I mean that it can fit 8-10 people) reception area with a fireplace. Beyond that, there is a dining space that looks like a long, narrow hallway. If you look closer though, you'll see that it is in fact a tiny room with a few tables cleverly reflected in a wall mirror. There is a bar off to another side room and an upstairs seating area as well.

While C&O definitely qualifies as fine dining, it aims to provide a comfortable atmosphere in it's traditional Virginia setting. Service was stellar and friendly (and thankful in one event) when I called several times on the phone as well as during our dinner.

To start, I had the arepa with braised pork, ricotta cheese, and pickled onions. This was an app that blew me away. The ricotta was housemade and not overpowering. The braised shredded pork was flavorful and tender. And I really liked the pickled red onions. Everything came together well on the arepa, a thick corn flour tortilla/bread, which may have been a little too thick as it tended to overpower some of the ingredients on top with its doughiness.

I had the bistro steak with sauce bordelaise. I do not think the cut of steak selected for the dish did it justice. Bistro steak tends to be soft on the outside but sinewy on the inside. However this cut of bistro steak may have been a little more sinewy than usual (only reason for 4.5 stars). Even with medium rare to avoid any toughness, I had a hard time cutting (much less chewing) this steak. As did others of my group. The outside had a nice smokey, seared flavor and went wonderfully with the red wine sauce and mashed potatoes (very flavorful with skin, the best kind of mashed potatoes) and some garlic sauteed asparagus (which were very fresh and young).

For dessert: the yummy Chocolate Pot de Creme. By this time, I was extremely full but I didn't want this excellent dessert to go to waste. It was not a rich chocolate and it had hints of cinnamon and/or nutmeg that made it unique and tasty.

Other notes: Crab and polenta looked tempting. Linguine with littleneck clams were housemade with beautiful coloring and thickness, served with whole large clam and not those dinky ones that come in canned soups. Creme brulee had beautiful looking and tasting caramelization, however the layer of custard itself was very thin. Cobblers came out piping hot and looked delicious.",497.0,C&O,0.9957,Tuesday
364,2011-11-27,4.0,"This place came highly recommended - both from our hotel concierge, numerous pieces of printed material and many comments from people in the area. I can tell you, however, to ignore your first impression of the place - an old Pepsi sing hangs on the front of an older brick building, paint peeling from an old sign on the wall as well.

There was a film festival going on the weekend we were in town but we stopped in on a Friday to see if we could get a table somehow (everyone told us it would be impossible and they were right). The owner, David Simpson, was kind enough to give us a guided tour of the premises - up, down and outside. Everywhere we looked people seemed to be having a great time. We decided to try again before we left town.

Sunday night - we're in! David wasn't there but the hostess couldn't have been nicer and we were quickly seated in the downstairs dining room, which is also the bar.

Appetizers consisted of a House Salad for Carol and Local Chicken Soup with White Beans, topped with Chimichurri (fabulous). Entrees consisted of Blackened Alaska Salmon served with a sauteed potato/clam cake and buerre blanc. I had the Cuban Strip Steak with red onion Marmalade. Both entrees were excellent and the leftovers were nonexistent. 

Can't remember the wine we had with dinner but dessert for me consisted of a glass of Eades 17yr old Single Malt Speyside Scotch.

For our appetizers, we had the boston lettuce salad with pommery mustard dressing and the buffalo mozzarella which came with mushrooms and greens.  For our entrees, my partner ordered the steak chinoise (the forkful of steak and mashed potatoes dipped in the ginger sauce more or less melted in my mouth!) and I had the lamb and gnocchi (my mouth waters just remembering the complex flavor combinations of this dish).  I would not hesitate to order all of these again.  Of the drinks, my favorite was their hot toddy made with black tea, bourbon, and plenty of cloves!

C&O is a tiny three story restaurant located off the downtown mall.

In my most recent visit we started off with a special--the lobster risotto which was to die for and followed up by getting the strip. Kind of like there old Cuban steak which was a staple but it tastes like the same marinade and was delicious all the same. Homemade desserts left us almost in a food coma.

The setting is perfect for a date night as the ambiance is quiet, cozy and dimly lit. Plus, they tried to leave a few empty tables around us and other couples for privacy. Side note: Definitely call in advance for reservations, as they get booked and we had to take an earlier dinner.

We again ordered Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer, and it was just as I remembered it from the year before: High-quality meat with fresh arugula, salty parm and a crunchy hashed potato.

For our entrees: I got Bass with crab, while Michal got the Ribeye Steak with mushrooms and potatoes. Both were hearty, generous, filling and flavorful dishes. The fish was incredibly fork tender, yet had a crisp sear on the outside - cooked to perfection. The steak was cooked as Michal asked, medium rare, with his fav veggie that reminds him of his childhood in the woods of his grandfather's farm. We happily traded plates mid-meal to complete our own ""Surf and Turf.""

Dessert - Enjoyed a divine Marscapone Cheesecake. It was tiny but rich. I appreciated how there was no crust and just ""filling."" The server put a little candle in the middle for me to blow out - nice touch!

However, as a former vegetarian for 2 years, the meat smelled and tasted too strong for me. The main dish featured chicken with asparagus. The chicken was wrapped in ham - not a good combination. Also the white sauce killed the freshness of the chicken. Finally the dessert. I got raspberry frisk. Too sweet and chuncky.

Service at the bar was prompt and polite.  Bartender made solid effort at conversation.  With a couple orders of red wine I got the veal appetizer and veal entree (I know, probably a tad excessive).  The dishes were prepared quite differently from each other and I thought they were good compliment with each other. The veal appetizer was amazing.  I wanted to lick the plate clean.

The lemon caper sauce has slivers of lemon that give you a surprising tart bite that can be a bit bright if you aren't expecting it.

Some others ordered the steelhead trout and really enjoyed it as well.

Dessert was very satisfying. The creme brûlée was rich and smooth. The chocolate bread pudding was dense, rich, and moist.

382,2017-07-29,3.0,"WARNING: If you get the pork tacos, they are EXTREMELY spicy.

Ok, now back to this regularly scheduled review. Let me give you some context to that first statement and start from the beginning. I was visiting in the Charlottesville. area and had been bar hoping all night in dire need of a meal (I had skipped dinner. When we finally got the opportunity to find a place to sit down for a meal at midnight, just about every place was closed. One of the servers at another restaurant recommended that the best place to go for late night for was C&O and she highly recommended the pork tacos. I mean HIGHLY recommended them. So what's a girl to do? Off we go to find C&O to get ourselves some pork tacos.

We finally find it down the strip and were seated at the bottom floor of the restaurant near the bar. Seems as if they were going to be closely soon, too, so we needed to get our orders in quickly. Two of us at the table went with the pork tacos (we do as were told), and someone else went with the cheeseburger. The late night bar menu is really limited, so there wasn't much else to select from that could opt as a meal.

The pork tacos finally arrive and in my hazy, tipsy state, I go head first! I take my first bite and get slammed with a mouthful of flavors. Overall, the taco was really delicious, but I couldn't grab my glass of water fast enough. These are some SERIOUSLY spicy tacos. I'm not one to shy away from spice, I like it somewhere in the middle between getting my tongue burnt off and feeling the tingle. I was truly shocked at how hot these tacos were and I had no warning signs to let me know. The woman who recommended the place/tacos didn't mention anything. The waiter who took my order didn't mention anything. Most of all, the menu didn't say a single mention that these tacos were spicy. Nothing. 

Overall, I was only able to get through 2 of the 3 tacos before my mouth had to call it quits. I wouldn't say I left hungry, but I definitely didn't leave satisfied. I mentioned before, the tacos actually had the potential to be really delicious if they weren't so overpowered by the unexpected spice factor.

The food was well-presented, but I found some of the dishes too strong for me. I started off with the pear and pecorino ravioli, which was on the heavier side for a first course. The butter sauce was overwhelming, and overpowered the other flavors. I wasn't able to finish the dish because at one point, I felt like I was just consuming butter. I did try my friend's roasted sea scallops, which were flavorful and delicious. 

For the next course, I had the braised retreat farm lamb. The lamb did not have a gamey taste, but was a little salty. I'm glad it came with gnocchi to break up the taste, but still found myself reaching for the complimentary bread in between bites. 

Finally, I got the Meyer lemon creme brulee for dessert, which was definitely my favorite course. The creme brulee was smooth and fantastic! The huckleberry sauce adds a nice tart flavor.

Toilet was very dirty and shabby and old, not befitting such an upscale venue. Floor was all wet. Toilet paper, well let's just say I didn't dare use it. That says something about the conditions they are in. Luckily I have my own wipes.",894.0,C&O,0.9582,Wednesday

There are always so many things I want to try and nothing ever disappoints.

392,2019-03-07,4.0,"If not for the parking (now a short walk to the garage and they validate) this would easily be a 5 star review. The ambiance screams historic building and when you enter you're greeted by a warm and cozy wood-burning stove. Our party of 6 was escorted to the downstairs dining area tucked near the bar. The walls are unique wood panels and some even have hinges that make it seem like hidden areas are behind them (prohibition era stuff maybe?)

The food was amazing, no one at my table was disappointed with their selections. But be ready to open your wallet. I'm very guilty of buyer's remorse especially in this situation of three dollar signs, I was so happy with my entree of Duck Breast. My expectations were high of course! Others ordered two appetizers and had it served as their meal so that's obviously an option as well. I did tell someone in my party that it was the most I have ever enjoyed duck. Great flavors as the sweet potato, smoked bacon and apple hash interplayed with the richness of the duck. I was excited to try the huckleberry gastrique since I've never had huckleberries before. It had a sweeter flavor and very enjoyable on my pallet. A very nice drink selection as well, plenty of craft beers and wines to chose from. 

I wish I had known about the parking garage validation because that would have lessened the sting of the walk (in winter weather) and fee.",161.0,C&O,0.9947,Thursday
393,2019-05-06,5.0,"My partner and I almost regretted stuffing ourselves with delicious cocktails at Alley Light because we couldn't eat as much as we wanted here at C&O. We ended up with just a few appetizers: seared scallops, bibb salad, beef carpaccio, duck confit. I've reviewed each dish from least favorite to most. (I'd recommend all the dishes though)

Duck confit: The ricotta gnocchi was delicious and plumply stuffed making it quite heavy. While the duck jus and duck confit were cooked to perfection, the duck jus definitely added to the heaviness of the dish, as expected. While we cleaned the plate, it was most difficult to scarf down. 

Bibb salad: My partner loved it. I thought it was small, even as an appetizer. Flavor was there but it was simply 7 leaves. 

Seared scallops: I put this 2nd best only because of the very minor nuances. The scallops are always tricky because if it's just slightly overcooked, the middle becomes chewy. These scallops were perfectly seared but slightly too salty. Combined with the cauliflower puree, the salt hid a bit but the cauliflower puree had some sour milk to it too so that was a little strange.

Beef carpaccio: Found no flaw in this. The greens that came with it were so deliciously dressed and came with very thin slices of raw beef. 

Service was excellent as was the ambiance. I'd love to come back some other time to try the main entrees.",420.0,C&O,0.9866,Monday

   My family and I ate at the C&O after my son's graduation and we had a very nice and delicious meal, probably one of the best ones we've had in a long time. 
   After our meal, my daughter asked if we could ask for a flower from the table to leave at the Heather Heyer Memorial on the street on our way back to the parking lot. (I'm attaching a picture of the very small vase and flowers at our table.) I said I would ask.
   I approached a group of people by the bar and asked a server if we could take one flower and I explained why we were requesting it. She said she did not think there would be a problem, but she had to ask the manager, she then turned to a lady next to her and asked her, the lady then turned to me and after I explained again what I wanted she said that ""We still have two more services and if you'd like flowers, there is a very nice shop downtown at 4th street, etc., etc, and I'm sure they'd be happy to sell you all the flowers you'd like"".
   This response really turned me off after the nice meal we had just had. We had just paid for a $70.00dll/a person meal plus drinks and this lady manager had no qualms about sending us downtown for a flower. 
   Sometimes you have to use your judgement and think that a flower (Lily of the Incas, not expensive at all!!!) is not worth losing some potential clients, especially after these customers have just paid a good amount of money for your product.
   I wrote to the management, and the owner of the restaurant apologized and expressed his shock (his words) at the reaction to my request. He said in his email that he would take appropriate action and that's it. I have not heard from them and I don't know if I'll be back there. 
   Sad ending to a perfect meal.

I love the grilled cheese and tomato soup so much, but as Zhana mentioned it is a big portion and might be better for sharing depending on how hungry you are. Usually I love their burger as well, though sometimes it can be inconsistent-- I've had some that were pretty burnt. They recently changed to their summer burger (lettuce, tomato, jalapeño aioli) which I like less than the winter burger (I think it has cheese and onions/mushrooms) but it is nice that they keep it seasonal. 

I've had a few of their cocktails and while they are pretty good, you're just as well off ordering your favorite fancy cocktail (dirty gin martini on the rocks for me) because the bartenders are very competent. I like the ambiance in here-- dimly lit and sexy. Makes me feel classier than I am! 

The food at dinner is also great though definitely more expensive than late nite. The dining room upstairs is nicer than the main floor but I also like the terrace out back. In particular I recommend the steak chinoise which has been on their menu since they opened. The sauce it comes with is super unique and delicious as well! Definitely recommend closing out the meal with the chocolate bread pudding for dessert-- it's to die for! 

I'm knocking off a star not only because of the inconsistency of the burger but also because I've had a number of times at late nite when the staff is just rude. I get that it sucks to be working so late but I would expect more from such a classy establishment.",170.0,C&O,0.9983,Friday

The late night burger has never let me down even though I think they recently changed it. The grilled cheese and tomato soup is very cravable. Another item that was awesome when they had it was the late night taco. I am mentioning this item because I hope management brings it back!!

Other than the great food at C&O you can get a pretty tasty cocktail. I appreciate a libation that makes you remember a place. The Alley Lite also does an excellent job at the food/cocktail combo but I digress. The atmosphere in C&O is different per floor and cozy in areas. An experience worthy of a visit.

The food at dinner is yummy but more expensive than late nite. The dining room upstairs is nicer than the main floor (girlfriend had to use the bathroom up there so we got to check it out).

For starters, we had tagliatelle, which was light with a great grated cheese on top, and scallops, which were cooked perfectly. Our mains were ribeye involtini (perfect cook, lots of flavor) and duck confit (great crispy skin, cleared the whole plate).

The only thing we were disappointed in was the dessert. The sticky pudding was crunchy on the outside like it was overcooked. I had a peaches and ice cream dessert and the peaches were not ripe at all. There was no flavor and they were so hard that it was difficult to eat. I would have rather them tell me that they took it off the menu if they didn't have ripe peaches.

The cocktails are expertly crafted, and the late night menu is small but mighty.

My husband's favorite is the grilled cheese with tomato soup - it's perfect for a chilly night! I most recently had the local Bibb lettuce salad. The mustardy vinaigrette is done just right and the gruyere is a nice complement to the lighter Bibb lettuce.

We loved the cozy, historical atmosphere, sitting upstairs by a wreathed window overlooking the railroad (where it gets its name). 

The food was amazing! We have lived in Northern California for about 8 years and have become spoiled by their food options. When visiting the east coast, we do not often find food up to that caliber, but C and O definitely did. We started with a light salad with a dressing that I would love to replicate. Next, along with the awesome shaved brussels, we had the trout and duck entrees; both were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. To finish, I got a cheese plate and my husband got a chocolate treat.

Restaurant is small, and seating is limited - but they fully utilize all three levels of the small historic building they are located in.  It is January - and cold.  I do think the restaurant was not super well insulated - so if you run cold, bring an extra sweater.

Service is exceptional.  From coat check, to check in, to meal - everything was top notch.  Parking is validated in the Market St and Water St garages - bringing the parking fee down to $1! Such a wonderful convenience.

Now the food is excellent.  To start, I had the beef carpaccio - which I would reorder in an instant.  Thin sliced beef with a nice creamy sauce thin layer and dressed with a lovely arugula and parmesan cloud of delight.  My main was the duck confit- and it was savory and delicious.  It is hearty but not super gamey.  My dinner partner got the lamb cassoulet and it was an equally hearty more ragout style.  Dessert was a little disappointing for me - I got the sticky toffee pudding and found it underwhleming.  The cake was a burnt on the bottom, and the toffee sauce was excessively sweet.  Creme Fraiche though was on point.  the cheese dish was so tasty - I might consider making that my dessert next time.  A great combo of creamy and stinky - the cheese selection was absolute fire.

The atmosphere here feels more upscale, with a nice warm fire greeting you during colder months. There's seating for dinner both upstairs and downstairs. It's small place so I'd recommend asking for upstairs seating if possible--you get more room.

Entrees: had to get the duck confit and the farm lamb cassoulet. Overall, I will say that these were similar dishes - savory, filling, and strong on the flavors. Nothing was mild or subtle!

Dessert: I got the sticky toffee pudding and my husband got the coupe ellery. I loved the pudding - it honestly tasted just like it looks. Super sweet, with amazing heavy caramel flavors. The ellery was the opposite; light and refreshing.

C&O is my favorite restaurant in Charlottesville, has been for many years. Later, I can write lovingly about the ambience and service, etc. For now, I want to focus on the pandemic takeout experience. In short, it's perfect.

They offer a changing takeout menu each week, with some a la carte options. You can order online, then pick up the next evening. You just pull up in front and they'll ask your name, and bring your order out. You don't even have to get out of the car, thus very limited exposure. And you can tell they're taking it seriously: gloves, mask, hand sanitizer, etc. It's all smooth and professional.

We've been ordering once a week or so, and I've been amazed at how well the food travels. Even my favorite delicate dish, the pan fried trout (amandine), reheats beautifully in a warm oven. Ricotta gnocchi with duck confit, striped bass, sticky toffee pudding, etc. - most of my favorite dishes rotate in eventually and have been excellent. 

The price is fairly high, for our food budget at least, but given the quality of the food and generous portions of the sides, salad, and dessert that come with each meal - I think it's a great value. We are certainly delighted with it and plan to keep ordering regularly.",11.0,C&O,0.9898,Wednesday

They had great options for all 3 courses- I didn't feel like I was having to settle as multiple items from each course sounded delicious. 

For my appetizer, I got the Hamachi Crudo. It was very fresh and plentiful. There was a sweet sauce on top that cut into the fattiness. My SO got the russet potato gnocchi with king crab. It was a $12 upcharge. I wish it was a little bigger portion or had more crab, but besides the size it was fantastic taste. There was an incredible sauce that really brought it all together. For the entrees, I got the duck breast and he got the steak chinoise. Both were delicious and plenty big enough, but WOW his steak was out of this world. I was nervous the tamari ginger sauce on it would be overpowering but it melded perfectly with the steak. The potatoes (on both dishes) were buttery in texture and delicious in taste. Lastly, for dessert we got the chocolate pavé and coconut gateau. As I'm not a big  sweet person (and at that point already very full), I didn't rage over either but nonetheless had no complaints.

Some of them said they weren't ""creative"" or stellar but nobody outwardly said it was bad. I just wanted to give my honest experience for those whose entire days can be ruined by a bad meal.

My family is visiting from Florida and I wrote up a full Charlottesville itinerary. It was their first trip here so I wanted it to be special. I was between Fleurie and C&O for tonight and WISH I picked Fleurie. The menu seemed strong, but boy was the food not good (at least for me).

I started with a glass of wine and the new pasta special. I LOVE pasta, especially house made. It was honestly awful. It just didn't taste right. When the best feature of a dish is... English peas, something isn't right. It had an awful sauce and didn't TASTE like the description. My brother had the beef carpaccio and raved about it and my mom had the scallops and they were excellent. I'm glad they were happy but it was honestly one of the worst dishes I've ever had. I had high hopes for my entree since the waitress (who was honestly amazing otherwise) recommended it. I had the lamb and my brother and mom had the halibut. The lamb was criminally bad. It had... another gross sauce on it. It was almost drowned in this sauce. It was served over a bland polenta. I haven't had many lamb dishes I didn't like, but this one was hard to eat. This time, my family said the halibut was severely overcooked but the sauce was delicious. For dessert I had the creme brûlée and it was good. My brothers cheese plate looked like airline food.

Overall... beauty atmosphere, stellar service, but I spent over $100 for awful food. Very upsetting. Maybe I ordered wrong or something but I don't care to go back and find out. For the love of god CHILL on the sauces on literally everything.",397.0,C&O,0.9618,Saturday

The restaurant is eclectic with a dark and moody bistro downstairs and an airy, more homey upstairs. I expected people to be dressed a little more tastefully but most guys weren't even wearing collared shirts, it seemed. 

We went all out and got cocktails, apps, entrees and desserts each and it goes without saying -- everything, everything, everything was delectable. My wife ate the seared tuna and she will never touch raw(ish) fish like that, and here she is trying to take more pieces. I got the steak chinoise and naturally it was incredible with the ginger-tamari bearnaise. I love high dollar steak but compared to the simplicity of a nice filet, it is elevated when you have a steak that you can just mop up plate sauce with. 

My wife ordered the duck confit app as an entree which is fitting it comes out looking like an entree. That's the one weird thing that stuck out with us - why is this on the app menu? How is this supposed to be shareable? Regardless the ducks fall apart and the ricotta gnocchi are perfect. 

The cocktails were great. The dessert was great. The server was great. The experience was great. 10/10 will be making a return trip every time.",19.0,C&O,0.9948,Thursday

We had a reservation for my birthday.  We were seated with a great ordeal, in an empty restaurant right on top of other people enjoying their dinner.  We were so close that we could have ate their dinner. 

It took forever to get served and it seemed like the server had better things to do than serve us.

We were seated at an intimate location. The interior is warm, quiet & inviting, however the exterior is quite deceptive.
The service was spectacular. We felt as if we had a dedicated server. He was very attentive, at the same time unobtrusive.
While the menu is relatively limited, I still wanted to try everything! We had a difficult time deciding.
Now to the food! WOW!  I really don't know what they could possibly need to receive a Michelin award. Flavors perfectly blended, cooked to perfection with beautiful presentation. Hubs had salmon, I had tuna....OH MY GOSH!!

431,2021-12-22,3.0,"Let's me start this by saying We love C&O.  The ""we"" is my wife and I.   We live Downtown and have a wide selection of restaurants from which to choose and definitely have our favorites.  C&O always makes that list even though we frequent it less often than many others.  It's pricier for one and harder to get a table for another.  So, all of that said, we hadn't been in since Covid started and were excited to go back last week.  The charm is still there.  The downstairs bar is our favorite, feels like a different world in a good way.  And the wait staff is lovely and attentive.   My main issue - and the reason for the 3-star review - is that the food has slipped significantly while the prices have risen dramatically.  Menu has changed - plenty of favorites now gone.   My Rockfish was OK - but swimming in Sweet Potato (roasted fall squash according to the menu) to the point that the flavor of the dish was basically sweet potato pie.  I scraped 2/3's of it off and it still was overwhelmed with 'squash'.    $42 for a small piece of rockfish and a can of sweet potato.  The prices here are competing with NYC prices. But the food isn't keeping up.  I worry that regulars are going to get priced out.  I understand Covid has changed the game for restaurants - it's incredibly hard to hire good staff, food prices and inflation are going in the wrong direction, the lingering fear of the pandemic has decimated traffic.  How to survive?  I don't have the answer.  But when we think of going out for dinner next time, C&O will be off the short list b/c I just don't feel like paying $40+ for mediocre piece of fish or $50 for a decent but unexceptional piece of steak.  Breaks my heart to write this but I feel like it's a matter of time before the equation for what makes C&O such an incredible place gets decimated.  I hope I'm wrong.",82.0,C&O,0.9848,Wednesday

The cocktails were really sweet and not unique. Like, if you're only doing the classics, then make them perfect. The arugula salad with warm goat cheese was good--but it's also hard to mess up heating up cheese. The roasted scallops were pretty good too, and I was happy with them, but not the best I've ever had. The duck confit gnocchi was where we were REALLY disappointed.

The scallops are $24 and there are 4, maybe 5 total so I do NOT recommend that dish. But their beef tartare is some of the best in town. Drinks on the menu or off, their bartender will make it delicious! It is a little off the mall so you can park a bit down the street and walk. Pre-pandemic they had late night C&O which was a great post date or night out nightcap. The prices were much more affordable but the standards and taste was just as good. I hope they bring that back.

Potatoes au gratin were good, but fairly plain (hard to care when the steak they came with stole the show).  Ended the meal with a delicious crème brûlée.

Came here for Dinner Friday May 20

Service was poor. Note this was no surprise as you've known for a year this would be a busy nights

Bar - bartender was very very very slow 

Fresh bread was stale (warmed up) and so hard I almost cracked a tooth. 

 ++ Appetizer- salmon, pasta and carpaccio were excellent 

++ Main - duck (fair) , tenderloin and lamb very good with tender and deep flavors

- - - Potatoes and asparagus were cold, ice cold!!

+ Dessert was good, toffee pudding was extraordinary, creme brûlée was pre made, dark chocolate bread pudding was okay

- - - - Service was disappointing (server she took our order and never came back) some other guy serving water who we'd not seen at all came up 75% through our meal and asked how our meal was...kinda a fly by.

- I ordered a second round of drinks that took 14 minutes (meal was over) server never came back!!

For a big celebration we had a good time but not without distractions you created that could easily have been avoided!

The highlight of the night for me was the crab cake. This was hands down the best crab cake I have ever tried. So much flavor and they did not skimp on the crab meat. I love the sauce and tomato garnish. The sticky toffee cake was my second favorite dish. The flavor was cinnamony, rich and indulgent. The salmon was pretty good but nothing too memorable.

We started off with some bread and butter which was pretty good. We ordered 2 appetizers to share which were the butternut squat ravioli and the braised retreat farm lamb. Everything came out great and the lamb was a treat to eat. The butternut squash was amazing too. We got cocktails as well and I did not like mine but the server had no problem with exchanging it for something I enjoyed. The only reason why I left a star out was because we were waiting for our server to come back and offer us dessert but we had to ask someone else. It took awhile for him to come back to us.

Second I ordered the New York strip steak and it was cooked medium rare which is perfect. Part of the meat almost dissolves in your mouth and other parts were a little more chewier. I'd def order again. My bf got the roasted halibut which he loved. I ordered the coconut cake for dessert and it was perfect. It was extremely moist and just dissolves in your mouth. 10/10 recommend this place. The service was on point. Our waiter was so sweet, very knowledgeable I wish I knew his name.

We were seated upstairs which I would call a ""grandmas house"" vibe. Cream colored walls with landscape paintings, white tablecloths and wooden chairs with woven straw seats. I was in the corner beside a large glass window that was parallel to someone's apartment who also had a large glass window. We were maybe 40' from each other? A straight line of sight between the person on his couch and me at the dinner table. Somewhat uncomfortable but not a deal breaker. The menu had a variety of offerings and we settled on the tuna crudo app, halibut for me and salmon for my partner. The tuna was delicious, great use of herbs/olive oil to flavor. The halibut was just ok. It was drenched in a lemon butter sauce, like when you hit the bottom of a ketchup bottle and it empties onto your plate. I scraped off what I could to get a taste of the fish, which was good. There was also what the waiter called a relish on the plate as well but it tasted like a chunky spaghetti sauce. The flavor didn't pair well with the lemon butter, seemed like two opposing tastes. My guy enjoyed his salmon. It was supposed to be potato crusted but only 1/3 of the top of the fish was covered. We skipped dessert as we were pressed for time to get somewhere else. The service was great and made up for the disappointment of my meal. Now that I've dined I would definitely go again but next time ask for any sauces on the side if possible and to sit downstairs where it's a low-lit sexier vibe where you don't run the risk of eating across from someone on their couch.

Appetizer of Shishito Peppers which was good but could have been better without what I believe was garlic aioli. Companion had Salmon and rated it as outstanding. Nice, slightly crispy outside while translucent in the interior. Not over cooked. I had the Steak Chinois. Wasn't blown away. Cut of beef was good and although sliced at presentation, was a bit tough. Still it was cooked as I requested. I felt the sauce atop took away from the meat's taste and it somewhat ""buried"" the steak.  Desert of Sticky Toffee Pudding was served warm.  It was good but not something I'd order again.  The menu at C&O is, as noted, somewhat small but to be expected given the quality of the food and presentation.  Prices are no worse than any other fine dining restaurant.  Would I return?

Here's the thing: You need to like creamy dishes. Sorry, I mean you need to LOVE creamy dishes. The Steak Chinois is soaking in sauce. The duck breast special was delightful, but glazed to within an inch of its, er, life. We like to see the protein shine through on its own, but here every beef, duck, and (I'm assuming from the menu description) lamb is drenched in a tasty if over-applied sauce. This reminds me of Julia Child's American invasion. Of what we thought French food was 30 years ago. Even the Brussel Sprouts did laps through an aioli sauce. Everything seems to ride atop a bed of puree - be it potato or cauliflower or whatever. The meat was cooked perfectly, the dishes were tasty. But the overwhelming presence of a cream note to nearly everything on the menu (from reading, we only tried two)? 

Again, if you like saucy dishes, this is your Eden. 

We would love to come back when the sauce to protein/vegetable is more balanced. We are new to the area, and this approach seems to be working for this gem of a location - but goodness this was rich.

The manager came over and asked if I'd like to move upstairs bc she knew I'd requested a quiet table.  That was great.  I appreciated that.

So we moved upstairs to a much quieter table by the window.

It went downhill after that.  Our server was french or something and he was rude.  It took a LONG time for him to come take our drink orders and when he asked if we wanted wine I said no and my mom ordered a tea.  He then asked if we were all OK with water and I said, let me see the drink menu, while I was looking, he simply walked away.  He didn't ask my husband or my mom's fiancee what they wanted.  We were like, what? 

My husband went to hunt him down and he came back and I said, just because we hadn't ordered wine didn't mean we didn't want something else to drink.  I ordered a tea and they ordered a beer and bourbon.  

After about 10 minutes I asked him where my tea was and he said ""Maybe I would get it"".  I was pissed, he was rude about it and you could tell he was trying to be a smart ass.  I realize bar drinks take a minute - but this was sweet tea and he was clearly catering to all his other tables and ignoring ours. 

I was pissed and planned to tell him off about how rude he had been from the start and exactly what we had done to offend him when I was trying to have a nice birthday dinner with my mom who I never see.  It's pricey to eat here - with entrees around $35-50 each and I don't want to be talked down to  or treated badly by servers when I've been nothing but polite.  I used to wait tables so I am a generous tipper and try to be mindful of asking for too much or try to give advance notice. 

The food was actually very good.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I had the potato encrusted salmon, my mom ordered the halibut, and my husband had their signature steak steak dish and I thought it was the best dish of the night.

They have a nice dessert menu and I saw several things I wanted to try but I went with the sticky toffee pudding in the end and it was very good.  They put a little candle on it for my birthday.

The saving grace was the same manager who helped me in the beginning, she brought us bread when I spoke to her and asked if they were out and had the kitchen heat up a little something else.  Our server didn't even try. 

My husband informed her of the issues we'd had and she was clearly appalled - she handled it very well and ended up comping the entire meal.  Rare.  Not what we expected at all...

It's nice inside with a cool vibe, the food was delicious and the manager was a 10. So, we'd come back again despite the rude server who almost ruined my bday dinner.",3183.0,C&O,0.9851,Friday

For my entree, I got the duck confit and ricotta gnocchi. I was hesitant to get this since I don't typically order duck, but the waitress promised it was delicious. Sure enough, this was a memorable dish! The duck was so tender and roasted in a sauce that was flavorful and not overly salty. The ricotta gnocchi was a great accompaniment to the dish. My only wish is that there was more- I think there were only 4 or 5 total. My husband tried the crab cake and bolognese. I'm glad he got two dishes because one certainly wouldn't have filled him up. The crab cake was not skimpy on the crab and was paired with a nice sauce. The bolognese pasta was also pretty tasty. We ended the meal with creme brûlée. While it was pretty good, I've had better.

Visit: October 2023

Shenandoah National Park in Virginia is one of the top spots in the United States to enjoy fall foliage, and my wife Jun and I had visited the park on a road trip every fall since we moved to the DC area. While we stayed at different places around the park, we had not visited Charlottesville where the University of Virginia is located until this year. When we finalized our plan to stay overnight in Charlottesville in late October last year after driving through the stunning Skyline Drive, I was looking for a restaurant to grab dinner. C&O, which had long been one of the most beloved institutions in the town, appeared in all of the several ""where to dine in Charlottesville"" lists I had found online. After our dinner at the restaurant, we both agreed that C&O is a solid choice for those visiting Charlottesville.  

The menu at C&O features classic dishes with French countryside influence. There won't likely to be a dish you hadn't seen before, but that doesn't mean the execution from the kitchen was overall good. We started with skillfully pan roasted scallops with whipped cauliflower, and shared a couple of main dishes in duck confit on top of ricotta gnocchi and grilled lamb chops. Jun, who has high standard when it comes to duck dishes, praised the duck confit as above average, and I thought the lamb chops (which came with mint salsa verde and potato puree) were grilled quite nicely. If you have room for dessert after savory dishes, I highly recommend trying a few at C&O. We both savored the vanilla crème brulee with enthusiasm, and the wild huckleberry sundae with caramelized pistachios was also wonderfully delightful.   

When we entered the restaurant, Jun and I were surprised to find white tablecloth on dining tables; we just hadn't expected a more formal dining experience, especially given the somewhat modest look of the exterior. If you are looking for a romantic dinner, I recommend asking the staff to be seated at the back of the dining room with candlelit tables. The wine list was another pleasant surprise at C&O where you will find an expansive group of bottles at varying prices from different parts of the world. If you are driving to the restaurant, you can park your car at a public parking garage nearby (the restaurant offers parking validation). While we have yet to fully understand or embrace what life in the Virginia countryside is like, I feel C&O quite adequately captures the culture and ethos of the region with soulful dishes that may not dazzle you like a Michelin star fine dining restaurant does but will nevertheless make you smile with satisfaction.",721.0,C&O,0.9977,Wednesday

It seems as though the quality has declined over the last few years. 

*The patatas bravas are still good, the tortilla española has been too oily, cheese plates have been significantly downsized (but still tasty), and the seafood from time to time is over-sauced. 

If you aren't a tapas fanatic, you may still enjoy the restaurant because, even with the few 'not so perfect', most of the dishes are prepared and served wonderfully.

The seating is a bit limited but they also have patio seating But it was cold so we chose to sit inside. We ordered  a few tapas and 1 large pitcher of Sangria (they only have red) which has about 6-8 cups. It is a bit stronger then sangria that i've had but it's really good. The tapas  we tried were:

Datil con tocino -fat, juicy, pitted Medjool dates roasted inside of applewood-smoked bacon-really good mix of sweet and salty

Jamon y queso -18 mos. aged Jamon Serrano and Manchego Cheese- good but it needed a crunchy element

Empanada-roasted local , organic pumpkin from Radical Roots,chevre,sage in a flaky pastry w/ crema, honey- the chevre overpowered the pumpkin a bit

Judion-local,pastured  Mangalisa pork belly w/ buttery white beans from Leon,local organic chard,mirepox,tomatoes and herbes  -pork belly was melt in your mouth and the white beans were firm but had a soft center. I think I  could have eaten a whole bowl of them.

Pato confitado-raditional Catalan dish of buttery duck confit w/ fresh figs, concord grapes., garlic,Amontillo, sweet butter

-figs were so fresh tasting 

wAtun-#1 Grade Yellowfin tuna grilled very rare only served w/smoked tomato alioli,grey sea salt- smoked tomato alioli was amazingly good.Tuna was a bit too over done but I'm used to eating raw tuna.

Chorizo -eponymous pork,garlic and pimenton sausage lightly grilled w/hearth-baked bread-chorizo had a nice snap to it.

Tortilla Espanola
the classic  Spainish tapa of yukon gold potatoes,sweet onions,local farm eggs,extra virgin olive oil, gray sea salt.- Dish was good but the potatos and onions lacked a bit of flavor the gray sea salt on top helped but w/o the salt the dish was a bit plain.


Our fave tapas were the Dates wrapped in bacon, the wAtun  yellowfin tuna w/ the smoked tomato alioli and the Judion mangalisa pork belly with buttery white beans.

All the dishes were really good and you could taste the freshness in the local ingredients.

484,2012-11-17,4.0,"First things first: I don't like tapas. Call me crazy but small portions (or the shudder-inducing ""nibbles"" or ""small plates""), jacked-up prices, and a whole dinner built around communal sharing with an overriding aftertaste of hunger are not my idea of a good time. I'm quite surprised that the whole restaurant scene built around tapas has lasted as long as it has, because my philosophy is, I've found this awesome dish. I've ordered it. And now that I know how good it is, the sight of your fork coming closer and closer to the food in front of me is enough to bring a rush of red to my head. 

Anyway, I'm giving Mas a pass on my general resentment of Tapas, because I had heard for quite some time about how good the food was and I can fully back that up. Mas also features tons of locally sourced ingredients, from AMFog mushrooms to beef from Free Union Grass Farm and Silky Cow, which is nice in that you can taste how fresh everything is but bad in that if you don't get here early enough, the kitchen runs out of the more popular dishes, like the bacon-wrapped dates. The menu also has quite the complicated symbol and key system, with things like FUN, WILD-CAUGHT, and BALANCED PAIRING. 

My table first ordered a small pitcher of sangria to share, and it was the perfect acidic balance of fruit and wine. I will say that I could have easily gone without my one glass of sangria if it meant that the $20 could have gone towards two extra dishes, but the birthday girl requested some booze. But you want to hear about the food! These were the dishes that came recommended by both Yelpers, friends, and waitress. 

Datil con Tocino: aforementioned bacon-wrapped dates. Comes 4 in one bowl. It's kind of impossible how something so simple can taste so delicious, but this was one of the dishes that I wish we could order extra of. 

Ensalada de espinaca: baby spinach with pine nuts, raisins, and mango vinaigrette. Palette-cleanser and provided some greens. 

Papas con crema: like a potato lasagna stuffed with Manchego cheese. Wait a bit for the cheese to crystallize on the bottom and you get nice crispy dark brown bits. 

Roasted artichoke hearts and goat cheese: wished for more hearth-baked bread. 

Chorizo: pork + garlic + pimenton sausage. I'd be okay with eating this, cheese, bread, and wine for the rest of my life. My stomach probably wouldn't. 

Empanada: pastry turnover stuffed with pumpkin, ginger, sage, with some cheese-like creme on the side. More savory than sweet. 

Fat Gulf shrimp grilled in their shells: my eyes popped out of my head as soon as I spotted a waiter carrying these babies to a nearby table. So succulent. It was like everything else in the world had disappeared and all that remained was the shrimp and I. 

Albondigas: beef and pork meatballs. Wanted more shrimp. 

We also ordered the hugely disappointing goat cheese cheesecake: the goat cheese managed to overpower any hints of sweetness or sugar. The little dollops of raspberry syrup on the side did not help. 

Tip: come as early as possible. My group of 7 came here at around 5:30 on a Friday and snagged the last big table in the back. Fifteen minutes in, a line had already started forming for tables, though there were still a few empty seats in front of the bar.

Would like to come back soon to have a Racion of that shrimp all for myself.",1423.0,Mas Tapas,0.9955,Saturday
485,2012-11-29,3.0,"The menu changes often so I suggest talking with your waiter and ask for descriptions and suggestions. I love the open kitchen and watching the chef prepare all the dishes. The food comes out quickly so props to the chefs but the service can be extremely slow because it can really crowded. From my experiences, your waiter can really great or really bad. They really need to make their service more consistent. 

Many of the items are just wonderful on the menu and I really like how they stay conscious on using seasonal and local items. My favorites include the yukon gold potatoes with aloi, bacon wrapped dates, artichoke goat cheese dip, shrimp with aoli and sea salt, beef tartar, and raw tuna salad. The plates can range from $4-$20 for the ""tapas"" or regular size and they offer the double sized portion for each dish. I suggest staying towards the lower end because I feel like the more expensive items are not worth it and are not as easy to share. 

Some items may also be a miss so be careful--again, I recommend talking to your waiter and telling them your preferences! For example, I tried their chirizo once and they were like a charred bricks. The Serrano ham dish with the manchego cheese is also not worth it because it's just really thin slices of cured meat with even thinner slices of cheese. Their hummus was also not very special. 

Tip: They do not take reservations so it's best to go during off times or weekdays. The wait can be 1-2 hours .

Tip: Instead of ordering the bread alone which is already $4, order the cheese dips because they include their house bread for just a few bucks more.

Friendly waitress, intimate/classy yet fun setting (including a huge patio), fantastic food, killer sangrias, awesome company ... what else could you really want in a night?

The restaurant uses ingredients from about a dozen or more local companies, which is an added bonus. Lots of organic and fresh vegetables and free-range chicken. Just looking at the menu and the vast array of choices can be overwhelming, but I feel like a lot of thought has put into not only the types of ingredients used but the way they're cooked/paired together to prepare each dish.

We ordered plenty of food for the three of us to share and feast on, but the one I keep remembering is the bacon-wrapped dates. I didn't even know I liked dates! Fat, juicy and pitted, roasted inside of applewood-smoked bacon.

Actually, it looked dangerously rare in my opinion. 

When our waitress came by we asked if we could please get the meat cooked a little more as we were concerned about how raw it looked. Much to our surprise we were told the chef will not cook it anymore because it is suppose to be served very rare.  Hunh?  Is the chef eating with us?!?  Is the chef paying for it?!?

There are vegetarian options on the menu, but nothing really stood out.  

Moutabel - the description sounded better than it tasted!!  The beets just tasted like beet mush served with bread.  We couldn't taste the tahini or red peppers.  After a few bites the beets just become overwhelming.  

Queso cocido con alcachofa - goat cheese and artichokes.  This was ok, but the goat cheese was very heavy.  

Roasted veggies with bread - the bread was the best part (buttery and crunchy). The veggies were ok, nothing special and a bit bland.

Halibut - I liked this dish a lot and thought the fish was cooked very well.

That being said, I do acknowledge that one poster said for those who are foodies and have eaten elsewhere, this place is not that great. I would have to respectfully disagree - I have eaten in quite a few different U.S. cities (LA, Chicago, NYC, DC, Philly, etc.), as well as abroad, and still really enjoy Mas! 

I will say that the wait is pretty bad, but if you manage to entertain yourself for the +1 hour wait - I would say it's worth it. Why? Well, each dish is it's own little theatrical show. I felt the flavors were purposely chosen and paired and the items were prepared carefully and well. My personal favorite would be the lamb shank,  bacon wrapped dates (I know, I know, everyone said it already but it's for a reason!), as well as the papas bravas (not the sexiest dish, but I love the herbs used on the potatoes and the serving size is gracious).

Bottom line - this place has a nice exposed brick and wood charm that is akin to a lot of local owned places in NY and the atmosphere, although dim, feels upbeat and social.

I have to be honest here, you can never tell with tapas, so I was slightly unsure of how much to order, but picking 2-3 things each for our table of 4 left us all content and didn't break the bank. 

We started (and ended) our meal with the bacon wrapped dates (yep, they were so good we ordered them twice), a pitcher of sangria and a potato dish, while we waited at the bar for a table to open up.  

It took about an hour for our name to be called; the hostest wasn't comfortable quoting us a time when she put us on this list, since she said with tapas if people don't show up at the same time (I guess they were spread out this particular evening) it's hard to gauge how long they will stay.   I really appreciated her being so up-front about this. 

It was actually pretty cool watching the restaurant work so well together as a team! They were slammed, but you would never know it by the level of service we received.

Once we were seated we transferred our tab to our table (I double checked this didn't short the bartender and was assured it wouldn't) and ordered several more small plates to share. I LOVED the shrimp, the hummus, Plato de Jamon and the heirloom tomatoes.  

We split the goat cheese cheesecake (I was intrigued) and even though I wasn't a huge fan of it, my dinner companions had no problem making it disappear very quickly.

I finally got my chance to experience Mas when I went to UVa for a football weekend. We went on a Friday night around 9pm so we could eat some tapas and drink some sangria before hitting downtown.

We ended up waiting around 35 minutes so they could accommodate our table of 10 on what appeared to be a busy night. The wait wasn't too bad! The giant jug of Sangria (highly recommended - it's very good) kept us busy until we were ready to be seated.

We were seated outside with a few tables pushed together and everyone was comfortable. The server came around and gave us our menu's and took some drink orders. The menu is VERY extensive so you'll need to take a few minutes looking up and down it. Be careful though because there are so many things that sound amazing.

All of the food we ordered came out in a very reasonable amount of time too!

4/5 - Bacon wrapped dates - I'm not usually a fan of any type of date or bacon wrapped thing. Dates taste weird and usually when things are wrapped in bacon the bacon is still mushy or rubbery. These were a completely different story. The bacon was actually crispy around the date and the entire bite was delicious. Would definitely order these again.

5/5 - Manchego and apples - Obviously not the fanciest thing you can order but the quality of the cheese and apples was fantastic. Both had a ton of flavor and complimented each other very well.

3.5/5 - Jumbo shrimp with garlic aioli - I'm not the biggest fan of in-shell shrimp as I'm more of a butter and garlic drowned shrimp fan but this was still pretty good. Everyone around the table absolutely loved it.

4.5/5 - Carne asada - I will eat steak pretty much any way I can get it. They cook the carne asada rare only but I'm fine with it. It's topped with a smoked tomato aioli that pairs nicely with the rare beef.

5/5 - Octopus and Pork Noodle dish - I'm not sure what this dish was called but it was my favorite of the night by FAR. The pork was tender and the octopus was charred exactly how I like it. Not to mention it was spicy as hell so it was right up my alley. Loved it.

All in all I really enjoyed my meal here and it lived up to expectations. This isn't the fanciest style of tapas you will see out there but the food has just as much flavor as any other place.

Go for the wine selection, which is fairly large and interesting with European wines (I tried the red sangria excitedly, but didn't particularly like it).

We came here in a group of 2 prime time on a Friday night. There was quite a wait, as expected, so we split a bottle of wine as we waited. There wasn't much of a waiting area... I felt bad hovering over other tables as we waited, but there wasn't much of an option as it was too cold to wait outside.

Bar area was first come-first serve, but you kind of have to fight for it. Several people who came after us grabbed seats as soon as people at the bar stood up, so you may want to make clear to others behind you that you're waiting for the bar.

After about 45 minutes wait, we got a table downstairs. While we were waiting, we marked all the tapas we wanted on their paper menu. So, we didn't have to wait too long for our food to come out after we sat. 

All the tapas were soo delicious, so many must-tries!

""Papas Bravas"" - The potatoes with garlic aioli - SO fragrant and yummy, you just keep going back for more. This left us taking small bites just so we could savor it more. It's one of those that's such a simple and basic dish, but somehow I don't think I could replicate it at home.

""Carne asada"" - steak with tomato aioli. Offered in rare only - amazing and delicious! Make sure to dip each bite into the sauce. I'm making myself hungry as I type this...

Some kind of jumbo shrimp - pretty good although probably the least celebrated at our table that night. Not that it wasn't good, just overpowered by everything else that was more amazing. 

Artichoke and goat cheese dip - I really liked this. Although if you're not a big fan of goat cheese, I probably wouldn't recommend. The bread it was served with was extremely hard.. It made it hard to break off to eat with the dip.

Grilled octopus served over bread - cooked perfectly, softened octopus and paired really well with the breading. 

""Datil con tocino"" - bacon wrapped dates. Although it seems an appetizer, it was the last one to arrive at our table, so it acted as our dessert. And it just turned out to be perfect that way, as it's a little savory, a little sweet. Charred smokey taste and just so good. 

So that journey of 6 dishes is enough for you to try an explosion of different flavors, and it came out to about $60 total. Very reasonable price for how great it was!

Fun fact: their special of the night was barnacle. weird right?! We passed this time, but I look forward to to coming back maybe when I'm feeling adventurous and trying one of their other weird specials :P

SO: 4.5 stars for such awesome flavors but minus half a star for lack of waiting area and having to hover over other people's tables for almost an hour, and perhaps a suggestion for softer bread to accompany the dips!",255.0,Mas Tapas,0.9982,Monday

Our server was very kind and knowledgeable! She has excellent recommendations that adhered to our dietary restrictions! Definitely one of the best places in terms of service. 

On to why I didn't give the place 5 stars. The wine and cocktail menus come in actual binders. I thought that was very cute. And the actual menu is one piece of paper. Everyone knows that the alcohol and food options are plentiful. But having to squint in a low lighting dining area to read the crammed menu was not ideal. I would suggest having another binder just for food on it's on and creating quarter sheets of paper where people can write what they want to order. When visiting be prepared to ask your server for recommendations. Lucky for us we had a great server who hit the mark on our food orders!",22.0,Mas Tapas,0.9721,Saturday

This was obviously not as good as my grandma's food but it was pretty close. We had the tortilla, pulpo, brussel sprout, fried smelt, patatas bravas, and goat cheese cheese cake. It was all quite delicious and I would definitely go back if we want tapas when we're in Charlottesville next time. I was not a fan of the cheese cake at all.

The wine selection provides an excellent variety of Spanish reds and whites. The cocktail list is expansive. Try the Basil Gimlet!

Get there early. Mas Tapas does not take reservations.  When we arrived at 5:05 for 5:30 opening, there were already 30 people in line. The wait was well worth it.  Been there twice and will always go back for a pleasant and adventurous experience.

They then brought they last tapa, a set of bacon wrapped dates so charred they were nearly unrecognizable.  We were offered a paltry insincere apology with the caveat that ""this is what happens when it gets late around here"".  Our bill came and nothing was comped and there was no attempt to rectify our experience.

507,2017-12-16,5.0,"Definitely one of my favorites in Charlottesville! Food is very high quality, unique, flavorful, and overall heavenly. The menu is quite extensive- so many tapas to pick from! Drinks are great- especially the sangria. 

We started off the simple oven baked bread. It was nice and chewy in the inside and went so well with the olive oil and olives at the table. The ribeye was salted perfectly and served with freshly made basil! Every bite was rich and juicy. Probably my favorite meat dish. The empanada was crispy and the meat inside was spiced perfectly! There's only one empanada for the tapas portion but it's big enough to split it. 

My favorite tapa was the mussels. They were so fresh and juicy, and would have tasted amazing even without the sauce. The sauce, however, is to die for. It's this rich tomato puree that can be served as a nice tomato bisque, except it has all the juices from the mussels. There's a little piece of bread that comes with the dish, perfect for dipping into the sauce. I was surprised by how big this tapa was but even more surprised at how delicious the mussels were (seriously, best mussels I've ever had in my life). 

Patatas bravas are authentic (even better than the ones I've had in Seville actually). The garlic aioli sauce was such a nice combo with the hot, greasy potatoes. Be careful not to burn your tongue! They also make great leftovers and taste just as good microwaved. The carne asada was pretty good, too. Very high quality meat, they put too much sauce and it kind of drowned the entire dish. Finally, we had the truffle grilled cheese sandwich (I forgot the actual name on the menu). The bread was a tad too charred for my liking, but the rich flavor of the truffles and the warm, melted cheese made up for it. A very filling tapa! 

Mas Tapas is a great place to dine! Food is fantastic and will not disappoint. Ambiance is cozy and romantic and service is great. The tapas turned out to be larger than I thought. My boyfriend and I were absolutely stuffed after 7 tapas and had to take the patatas bravas home. There's limited parking in the little lot behind the restaurant. It's popular though, so get there a few minutes before it opens or anticipate a wait!",510.0,Mas Tapas,0.9989,Saturday
508,2018-01-08,4.0,"Without a doubt this is one of the best restaurants in Charlottesville! On the pricier end, for sure, but definitely worth it. 

The food: The sangria is excellent! Be sure to get a large pitcher ($30 and will be enough for about 8 glasses). Our favorite dishes were the Papas Bravas (potatoes with aioli), Queso cocido con alcachofa (artichoke and goat cheese spread), Trinxat (potatoes, cabbage, pork belly, duck fat), and Carne asada (WOW, this was great). The menu is extensive and is broken down into different price points. Our server was great about explaining the menu items and portion sizes to us so we could set expectations and determine how much to order. 

The logistics: They don't take reservations so I would suggest an early dinner or other odd times if you don't like to wait. I came with a group right when they opened at 5:30 and the restaurant was already filling up fairly quickly. This setting also isn't great for groups - they don't seat until the entire party is present and they don't split checks. The plates are fairly difficult to share with groups larger than 4 unless you're okay getting only a bite (or sometimes even half a bite) of certain dishes.

510,2018-04-04,5.0,"THE BIG: Located on the corner of Monticello and Carlton. Medium sized restaurant with no prior reservations aka first come first serve. There are outdoor seating, but only when it's nice outside. Street parking is available.

THE BLACK AND WHITE: We came here on a nice March night. Outside was still cold so none of the patio section was open but I can definitely picture a cool summer night with tapas and sangria.

I'm pretty sure there's always a wait because when we got here (~5:45pm), there were already 7 tables in front of us...and people still kept showing up. It took us about 45 minutes to get seated, thankfully we got a pitcher of sangria to hold us over. $30 for a large pitcher that serves 8 glasses, not bad.

---As for the food---
-Cauliflower: Curry flavored and essentially dissolved in your mouth
-Papas Bravas: The garlic aioli was dope and the potatoes were nicely cubed out
-Scallop: Just one scallop but it was done right. Had big roe pieces on top and a potato-ey spread below it. 
-Bacon-wrapped Dates: Sweet meets savory. Only comes with 4
-Carne Asada: Evenly cooked-cut steak with a nice serving of a buttery yellow sauce on top

- goat cheese artichoke dip: fine, not amazing; strong on chevre
- jamon: incredible quality but VERY small, sad pieces and very pricey (around $15) for what we got. 
- bacon wrapped dates: hard to mess this one up. good but I've had much bigger bacon wrapped dates elsewhere 
- lamb meatballs: good flavor but fell apart easily
- shrimp: very plump and grilled well, served with incredibly thick aioli
- carne asada: cooked well but I was disappointed by how the dish came out cold. who wants their meat served not hot? 

I did not order a drink, but my friends' sangria and cocktail were reportedly watered down and not very good. 

Overall, food was only okay and very pricey. We left feeling very confused by the line still out the door now being told for a wait of 2-2.5 hrs. definitely not worth the value or wait imo, I'd much rather dine at little john's or mellow mushroom pizza when in Charlottesville...",502.0,Mas Tapas,0.8822,Sunday
512,2018-06-03,2.0,"Came to Charlottesville from Northern Virginia and was stocked to try this place all weekend! So disappointed and kind of odd with all the other great reviews. 

Service: 2 of 5 - The moment we walked in the door we were rudely greeted and our information was taken down for the waitlist. Had 3 parties ahead of us and asked for a rough ballpark of estimated wait time and was abruptly told ""they don't give estimates"" as the girl rushed off. Okay, I get it - can't give wait times but she came across really inappropriately and almost made me want to walk out the door. Our actual server wasn't too bad. 

Food: 3 of 5 - I get it, this place puts a hipster vibe on Spanish Tapas but the authenticity was a poor excuse for the rendering of the concept. My boyfriend (who is Salvadoran) even noticed that the beer on their menu and country of origin listed were incorrect (pretty much a slap in the face) to Spanish culture. 

Value: 2 of 5 - Tried this spot on a mini-vacation and spent over $200 with drinks included for the two of us. The only dish that was remotely decent was the artichoke and goat cheese dip. Too bad this was the first dish we put in order in for and the very last thing we were served.

I don't know, I'll give them benefit of the doubt and maybe we caught them on a bad night but overLl a very poor experience. Will not be returning.",106.0,Mas Tapas,0.8714,Sunday
513,2018-06-24,1.0,"My friends and I were very excited about our trip to this restaurant. The entire time on our walk there, we discussed how happy we were to try this place. One of my friends, it was her birthday, had chosen this restaurant because she had always heard good things. I did not know much about it, but being from the Charlottesville area, I was familiar with the location. So, I knew the area wasn't going to be all that racially diverse thanks to all of the gentrification around the Belmont area. 

When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a host who urged us to choose a seat inside, so there would be less of a wait. We complied and were squeezed at a table in the rear of the restaurant. A waitress soon approached us and offered up a few friendly suggestions on what we should order. We let her know that two of my friends were vegetarians and that I was allergic to selfish, so we would have to steer clear of those options. She then proceeded to lecture me on carrying my epipen everywhere I go. This has never happened to me at a restaurant. i have also never been spoken to in such a condescending way by someone before. I have gone to many restaurants and told wait staff about my allergy and they are usually very understanding. This waitress was not. She made it seem like I had inconvenienced the entire restaurant. She very unenthusiastically said ""I'll have to run everything by the kitchen now.""

The rest of the meal was uncomfortable. I cannot remember if I even liked the taste of the food. All I can remember is a white woman yelling at me because of my food allergies. My advice to anyone who is interested in tapas in the Charlottesville area. Try Bang! It's within walking distance of this tone-deaf place and is actually quite delicious. There aren't weird photos of white people doing yoga on the walls and I was treated with respect and courtesy while I was. Moral of the story: Skip this place. It's expensive. They're rude. And you can definitely get a better meal somewhere else.

Their menu changes seasonally which means they always have something new and different to try. There are a few many staples, like the complimentary olives to start the meal and the bacon wrapped dates (we order them as dessert). I enjoy ordering a number of things (T/tapas size) so I can try more things. Most recently their scallop with corned cream was my favorite dish. I also love their selection of Spanish wines- especially how many they have by the glass!

The seasoning profile is pretty similar across all the items we ordered - olive oil, paprika, harrisa, etc. They are going for authentic Spanish tapas, which we appreciated. The patatas bravas were not like I am used to - small crispy potatoes - but rather big soft hunks in sauce. Bill was less than $100, but we did not order alcohol or meat.

It seems as if their menu is overwhelming with options, but the staff are always willing to explain and give their suggestions. Based on that, I ordered the carne asada for sure! The meat was so tender and flavorful, I almost wanted to order another, but had to save room for the other dishes. (All of their dishes come in two sizes!)

While its definitely worth trying, it didn't quite meet our expectations with many of the plates being a little underwhelming for the cost.  I wish I could tell you what plates we got but the menu is near indecipherable with names you'll never be able to remember (even immediately after ordering).  So you will place your order on the sheet provided for the table and then be surprised as the plates you order come out randomly.

Décor wise mas tapas is kind of all over the place.  When you walk it works hard to evoke that certain posh atmosphere with semi-uniformed / dressed-up staff to greet and serve you.  There's a nice variety of seating options with a neat, second room down a flight of stairs. Tapas also has a beautiful long bar for those looking to grab a quick seat.  Myself and the two women I was with agreed that the art on the wall was a little confusing.  I'm having problems remembering what I saw but it was an odd mash up of  overly sexual close-up photos.  

Drink wise I was happy with the dirty martini I received and the girls liked the wine options available to them.  Foodwise, we ordered a bread and cheese plate which came with slices of green apple.  While everything was good quality the presentation was pretty plain and underwhelming.  We liked the baked wings and I enjoyed the thin slice of rare beef.  Everyone loved the potatoes au gratin although the ladies commented that it was presented differently than they were used to.  Flavor-wise it was exceptional.

533,2019-08-13,3.0,"I had high hopes for Mas because it appeared on several Charlottesville restaurant lists, had great Yelp reviews, and was recommended by my husband who had an memorable meal here a couple of years ago. Unfortunately (and my husband would agree) that the food came up short this time. 

It was our first meal in Charlottesville after over 3 hours of driving in rush hour traffic from DC, so we were hungry and ready to be easily impressed. Our server, who reminded me of the leader singer of Muse, recommended a bunch of dishes and we ordered all of them: the cauliflower, papas bravas, tortilla Espanola​, grilled artichoke hearts with garlic aioli​, wild gulf shrimp, heirloom carrots, and ""ginormous"" sea scallop with parsnip & celery root puree. The cauliflower came out first and it raised the bar sky high. Roasted in coconut milk, ginger, turmeric, sweet onions, and sea salt, it was the best rendition of cauliflower I've ever had. I found myself trying to commit its subtle but warm and rich flavor to memory so that I could try to recreate it. Sadly, as the rest of the tapas came out, the bar set by the cauliflower quickly came crashing down. The carrots were undercooked, the papas bravas were mushy, the artichokes tasted like they were from a can, and the ""ginormous"" sea scallop was not ginormous enough to warrant a $14 price tag. These tapas tasted like they were made by a completely different caliber restaurant than the one that made the cauliflower. The gulf shrimp briefly interrupted the lackluster lineup. Large, juicy, and perfectly seasoned, they could stand on their own without the smooth garlic aioli that it sat on top of. I was particularly surprised that out of over 40 different tapas on the menu, our server did not recommend better ones. Not sure if he was upselling us (such as with the scallop) or trying to get rid of less popular ingredients. 

Thankfully the night ended on a sweet note with a delightful flourless chocolate cake. And the entire night was saved by the stellar gin cocktails and the chill, hipster atmosphere that made us feel young, cool, and transported from DC. 

Our bill came out to be ~$65pp with tax and tip which was about 20% more than I expected. I would consider giving Mas another try to cobble together a better tasting, better value lineup of tapas. If I fail to recreate their cauliflower, I'll have to.",46.0,Mas Tapas,0.991,Tuesday

Came by on a Friday night with a group of 6 friends and the place was packed! The staff clearly had their hands full, but were professional and put our names down for a table.

We settled in for a wait and ordered a round of cocktails (you can wait with your drink in the porch) We were pleasantly surprised and were seated as our cocktails were being prepared.

The tapas are among the most inventive and delicious I've had.

The carne asada was cooked to perfection, the mussels had a delicious smoky tomato based sauce/broth, the broccolini was simple but effective, and the mushroom tartlet was good too.

The cocktail spread has the usual suspects and are well made.

As we waited for nearly 25 minutes to have a server come to our table frustrations mounted. We went and looked for the host to ask for service. When our server finally arrived, we were not greeted with apologetic  pleasantry. Instead, we were hit with a ""first of all"". We were never explained the process for ordering and met with contempt when we had questions. After eating at many other tapas restaurants, Mas had a different process. While we should have just left calling the experience a wash, our hunger made us stay. 

After speaking to the manager our drinks and starter were comped, but still felt as though the reason for our concerns were not fully understood. 

Our server continued to provide mediocre service at best throughout the rest of our dinner. What should have been an enjoyable birthday dinner was significantly dampened by the lack of courtesy and care our server provided.

We both started with a cup of regular coffee. Minor complaint is that it didn't appear to be a bottomless cup. However we did order drinks for our meal, so maybe the server just assumed we didn't want more. 

For the meal I had the shrimp with polenta and a blood orange mimosa. All was great. While I had plenty to eat, for the price I thought my portion was a bit small. He had the biscocho jamon (Serrano ham and egg biscuit) plus a side of papas bravas y alioli (fried potatoes with aioli) and a Bloody Mary. The price/portion was better and all was delicious.

There's a small parking lot behind the restaurant which is nice.

Inside it's not very big but attractive. I just sat at the bar, which pretty much runs the length of the restaurant.

I was on my own so I started with the arugula salad and was pleased. There were several things that interested me but next I settled on the buratta-pesto-toast tapas thing and that was also good.
I debated ordering something else but decided to just get dessert instead.

I ordered the flan just because and honesty it exceeded my expectations. Cappuccino was also legit.

Service was fine and it wasn't very busy the night I was there. 

Only downside was I thought it was a bit expensive. The aforementioned salad and one tapas, glass of inexpensive wine and a cappuccino was north of $50 and honestly I was still a little hungry.

- coliflor: SO GOOD. Got turned onto this after trying it at conmole across the street a big who and I have to say, both places do an amazing job
- bacon wrapped dates: only came with 4 (two screens of two) but so good

The carne asada ended up being one of the better dishes and our favorite- caution, the meat may still be mooing. The chorizo was good, but definitely have had better. The posole (chicken stew) was bland and unimpressive...waste of stomach space. Then, we ordered the chuletas (lamb chops) and pescado (rockfish), which offered some promising flavors. The fish happened to be the table favorite. The bocato (pork cheek) was my personal favorite. Having some room left after all these dishes, we cumulatively decided to order 2 more dishes: pintxo (rabbit pate) and oyster mushrooms. Both of these dishes were awful and a disappointing end to our dinner. We basically forced our bites to finish our plates. The pate was a runny gravy slopped onto bread.

We started off with chorizo which was disappointing and carne asada. Having had chorizo at different Spanish / Hispanic restaurants, this one was mediocre. It lacked the spice of a typical highly seasoned Spanish pork sausage. The tenderloin that came with a warning of being grilled VERY RARE , was on point, delicious and definitely one of the best carne asada , according to my husband. The aioli with it brought out the flavor even more. 
We then moved on to Posole - chicken stew which was supposed  to have a nice blend of onions & poblano peppers which would have given it a nice distinctive taste. We thought it was just meh..
We also ordered Bocato which was braised pork cheeks with a delicious meld of flavors in a brioche. We loved it!
Another winner was the pescado which was a tasty, slightly crispy seared rockfish - definitely a must have!
The chuletas (baby lamb chops) unfortunately failed to impress. We think they were overly trimmed of fat.
We wanted to try something else so we ordered the Pintxo and the Hongos. We shouldn't have. Both dishes were unimpressive. The rabbit liver - black truffle pate was a tasteless gray smear on bread. The grilled mushrooms were neither interesting nor good. A shame that it was the last taste in our mouths at the end of our meal.

Tuna Salad - nice mix of arugula with plenty of chunks of yellowfin tuna plus capers, onions, and shaved manchego cheese. Super tasty. 

Albondigas - juicy beef/pork/lamb meatballs in a very flavorful romesco sauce.
 
Carne Asada - seared perfectly and then basically rare. My wife and I like it that way, but I'm sensitive that others like their beef cooked more.

Arroz con Pollo - I'm not sure if the chicken was smoked or the pepper in the sofrito, but this dish had a very nice smoky note to it.

Hummus - good pepper and garlic flavors in this version.

We finally got a chance to check out this Belmont staple again since moving back, and this time we brought friends. Doing so allowed us to sample even more of the menu. Happily, we found the food here as good as ever.

Dining with a party of four allowed us to sample nine different tapas, and not one was a dud. Some of our favorites included tender baby lamb chops paired with a zesty chimichurri, a tender roast octopus, a crock of creamy goat cheese-artichoke dip (perfect with the house crusty bread), and Mas's take on the classic patatas bravas (with roasted rather than fried spuds). While still good, some of the slightly less successful dishes we tried included the mussels (difficult to manage at a small table, and not the freshest) and the tortilla (eggs a bit overcooked and underseasoned). Though we ordered 9 dishes, they came out in waves of three which made negotiating the limited real estate at our tiny table feasible. 

The drink program here focuses on, unsurprisingly, Spanish wine with a tight selection of draft beer and some cocktails. My wife enjoyed her wine, though my cocktail was strictly okay.

The ensalada de atun had fresh tuna and a light dressing perfectly applied to the salad. The gambacitos al ajillo were divine with a scrumptious sauce.

It was difficult to find parking when we arrived, so getting there early is a must. There's a small lot behind the restaurant that was full when we got there. We ended up parking in a plaza lot across the street but wouldn't recommend it for risk of being towed.

FOOD
Oh gosh, the food here is absolutely stellar. Our table ordered the coliflor, papas bravas, tortilla espanola, boquerones, bocadillo, and arroz con pollo. They were all to die for, but the bocadillo took the cake for me. I'll have to try the desserts and the carne asada (heard nothing but good things about it) next time around.

The drinks were pretty standard (still wonderful), and were decorated nicely. No complaints here.

SERVICE
Our server was very kind. When our order didn't arrive for the hour we were there, he took it off our check. He also explained the vegetarian items available very well and sold us on the restaurant at large.

AMBIANCE
The ambiance was absolutely lovely. There's an open bar where you can see food being made, and the entryway to the two floors of the restaurant made it appear lofty and spacey. The art also fit the casual, fancy vibes as well.",400.0,Mas Tapas,0.9664,Sunday

The bacon wrapped dates were good; however, I've had them before elsewhere and can tell you that the addition of some blue cheese inside and a sprinkle of brown sugar would take these from good, to stellar.  The arroz con pollo, was a plate full of arroz and not much pollo, the piece of fat and another piece of gristle is what ultimately forced me to send this back.   Adding a star for the server who handled this well and took the item off our check.   We followed with the tortilla which were lackluster, warm, and a bit dry scalloped potatoes.    Even the Manchego cheese appetizer was off. I often buy Manchego at Costco and find the texture smoother and more flavorful.   One more tapas ordered were the lamb sliders, (1 slider actually), with goat cheese.   For those who like the stronger flavor of lamb if would be great to order, this was just too much for me.   $73 for 4 tapas (the chicken and mostly rice was deducted beforehand), a sangria and glass of wine.

My fiancé and I take an annual trip to Charlottesville. This was our first time visiting Mas Tapas with two of our close friends. We wined and dined till our hearts and bellies were full. We ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table. Let me tell you - the flavors were delectable, not to mention this drink was STRONG. We were all feeling good and relaxed after finishing one pitcher. 

The small plates. Where to begin? We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, chorizo, yellowfin tuna, carne asada, and, baked dessert cheese . . . just to name a few. Every plate was DELIGHTFUL. Packed full of flavor and prepared with an eye for detail. It's the type of food that is so good, your conversation only centers around the savoriness in your mouth. Every bite was divine. 

We had to take a deep breath when we received our bill, but honestly we paid for high quality. I think Mas Tapas may become an annual tradition for us. I highly recommend. Note - reservations are required and you will likely have to street park.",99.0,Mas Tapas,0.98,Wednesday

But it felt like they wanted us out of there much faster than that. 

We sat down at 7:20, placed our order around 7:30, and by 7:40 they had served 3 of the five tapas plates we had ordered. We hadn't even finished the first plate yet. 

Some of the dishes were quite good but others were not. Avoid the papas bravas which were both undercooked and charred at the same time.

590,2023-07-28,1.0,"RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL MANAGER! ALEX on Saturdays!

Is Alex a female  cause she likes to bark at customers...

I recently dined at Mas Tapas. We were placed at an awkward table b/c the table reserved for us had issues. Since we were seated in an awkward space, I went up to the host stand to see if we could sit in another area since there was ample open seating. As I'm speaking... Alex, their Saturday manager, cuts me off mid-sentence. She barked, ""NO."" at me, looked me dead in the face, and continued with her matters. I was stunned. Never have I been spoken to that way by service staff especially when it was completely uncalled for and unprompted.

Your stress levels do not give you a pass to mistreat people. I've worked in the service industry before and I NEVER treated guests that way. If any team member did so, they would be fired. It was very clear that one of their younger servers (who was such a pleasure) felt so uncomfortable. He tried to make it right... which is why I believe we got a few free drinks.

Alex never apologized... she continued to prance around like she's all that. Sorry to say, if you can't treat people with respect ESPECIALLY in the service industry... You are not all that and you have no business being in hospitality.

592,2024-02-03,2.0,"Yeeks... hate to give a poor review from a place I have always thought was the best. But tonight at Mas, the food was sad. The garlic shrimp was a big bowl of popcorn shrimp floating in sauce- like probably 20 shrimp, where it should have been 4 or so nice jumbo shrimp.  Sauce was okay but the garlic sauce I make at home kills this one. And that baby shrimp all curled in balls is so off putting. The lamb lollipops - the meat portion was a small as a nickel. I know lamb lollipops well and I know they are small but these were super super small.  The tomato bread was inedible. It was more like Italian bruschetta than Spanish tomato bread which would have been fine but the tomatoes were smoked and it was like a whole bottle of liquid smoke had been poured on them. It left a film in your mouth that you couldn't get rid of. It was way way too smoky and also a disappointment that it wasn't traditional Spanish tomato bread. The octopus was good in itself but served on a huge bed of very overwhelming romesco sauce. It needed maybe 6-8 dots of that sauce along the rim, but the sheer volume of that very strong sauce just overwhelmed the delicate octopus. Each dish that was laid in front of us was so poorly presented and ""off"" from the beauty and unctuousness of what nice tapas should be and used to be here.  The only good dish was a jamon and manchego on a roll- like a little sandwich. That and the wine were the only good parts of our meal tonight  as what used to be my favorite tapas restaurant ever. .",90.0,Mas Tapas,0.9955,Saturday
593,2024-03-24,5.0,"My mom and I came here on a Saturday night for a nice dinner on our way home from Williamsburg. Mas Tapas has been in Charlottesville for a while and is very highly regarded. The menu consists of tapas and Spanish styled food. You can order the food in a tapas size or a racion size, which is double the size of the tapa serving. We ended up splitting a variety of tapa dishes and left comfortably full. The interior is fun with an abstract flair to it. The service was busy, could have been more attentive. We didn't have a reservation and were lucky to get one of the last spots available at the bar. We both enjoyed eating at the bar and it allowed us to see them preparing all the dishes!

We ordered several things at once and they came freshly prepared and were served straight from the chefs. They were also spaced out nicely, we didn't receive everything at once but we didn't have to wait too long in between the tapas either. The jamon y queso came first which was a plate with ample amounts of jamon serrano reserva and manchego cheese. You can never go wrong with high quality meat and cheese, and this certainly didn't disappoint! The meat was similar to a prosciutto and paired magically with the sharp manchego cheese. The ensalada lechuga came next and it included baby lettuces, toasted pine nuts, sultanas, manchego cheese, and a mango vinaigrette. The salad was simple and light, but had great flavor, especially from the tangy mango dressing. After the salad, the coliflor arrived. It was cauliflower roasted with coconut milk, ginger, turmeric, and grey salt. Probably some of the most flavorful cauliflower we've ever eaten. The turmeric was delightful and added a complexity to an otherwise boring vegetable. The aueso y alcachofa and papas bravas arrived next. Both these dishes were absolutely amazing. The potatoes were cooked to perfection, with slightly crisp skins and a soft, fluffy interior. They were roasted with harissa and herbs, topped with a garlic aioli. The harissa added a slight spiciness to them and the creamy garlic aioli complimented the heat very well. Highly, highly recommend. The queso y alcachofa plate was a spinach artichoke like dip with roasted artichoke hearts, sweet onions, garlic, herbs, and goat cheese, served with their house made bread. This was outstanding! The goat cheese elevated the flavor of the artichokes so much and added some tang to it. The bread was heavenly and was perfect for serving the dip on. We decided to order a couple more items, included the lamburgeusa and the carne asada. The lamburguesa was a lamb and beef slider with feta, salsa especial, baby lettuces, served on a brioche roll with pickled veggies. The was a super flavorful slider and the brioche bun was downright amazing. The feta cheese was strong, but complimented the flavorful meat and sweetness of the bun. Last was the carne asada, arguably the most impressive tapa we had! The carne asada was grilled extremely rare to perfection, served with a duck fat tortilla topped with a herbaceous mojo verde sauce. Words cannot do justice for how perfectly cooked this steak was and just how much flavor it had. It was tender, with a nice char. The sauce overtop of it only amplified the flavor of the steak. We did end up ordering their chocolate sangria torte. It was essentially a flourless chocolate torte with a sangria flavor to it. The sangria was subtle, but present, and the raspberry coulee worked nicely with the richness of the chocolate. A great way to finish our amazing dinner!

All in all, we left full, very impressed, and more than satisfied! Everything we ordered had immense, unique, bold flavors that left us wowed. Each dish was different from the next and portioned perfectly. You can tell they really prioritize using high quality ingredients and it reflects in the flavors of the food. The restaurant has a cool vibe to it with pops of color and abstract art. While the service could have been more attentive, it wasn't poor.

599,2024-07-07,2.0,"Mas fell as flat as their 50 dollar Sangria. This used to be one of our favorite restaurants in Charlottesville, but it has fallen on hard times.

The Sangria was 50 bucks. Not a typo. Not 15 bucks. It tasted like a 5 dollar bottle of bad red wine with a few slices of fruit. Traditionally, a little brandy is added or sugar or something to bring out the flavor or liven it up. We ordered a little ginger ale to keep it from tasting like flat cheap wine

The olives were serviceable.

The bread and Machego was a half loaf of dry baguette and two pieces of manchego sliced like American cheese.

The atun(tuna) and arugula was similarly bland. Needed salt and some lemon may have helped.

Papas bravas is usually a staple of Spanish tapas. Roasted fingerling potatoes with an aioli or other sauce. Their variant had spicy harrissa sauce and aioli and might have been a good dish... If they remembered to add any salt. We asked our server for a small bowl of coarse sea salt or finishing salt. That little pinch made a huge difference.

Next was albondigas with romesco. This is meatballs with a pureed red pepper and garlic sauce, or it should be. We received the tiniest dried meatballs which were clearly overcooked. The were served in a thin oily gravy that bore little or no resemblance to romesco.

The datil or dates wrapped with bacon, lacked both the saltiness or the sweetness whose combination generally make this a favorite

The grilled pulpo(octopus) had thin caliber pieces with a rubbery texture. Again, the dish lacked salt and that necessary lemon, which might have brightened it up and brought out the flavors better.

The restaurant was not crowded but service was substandard. Nobody asked how the food was nor did they make the appropriate number of inquiries to see if we needed or wanted anything else.

The only reason I'm deducting a star is because our waitress acted super weird when the majority of us ordered pasta instead of entrees. She goes ""you guys and your pasta!

Atmosphere - I love the ambiance. The downstairs is sort of a classic wooden rustic bar area, and the upstairs is more of an open concept fancier restaurant with twinkle lights. If you have any family or friends visiting from out of town, this is a perfect place to take them for a nice, but casual night out with dinner and drinks.

Service - The service has always been super quick and the wait staff is extremely attentive, even when it's a busy Friday or weekend night.

Parking - There's not much parking in front, but there is a neighborhood on the parallel street over with ample amounts of street parking.

Most importantly, FOOD - I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't eat much meat. I LOVE their Truffled Mushroom Ragout. It's so creamy and rich without being too heavy. I usually get the double/larger portion so that I can take it home and have it for leftovers the next day for lunch!

Cheaper 'date night' prices, pretty solid food, super close and convenient.... overall Local is worth trying out. 

We followed the waiter's recommendations and got the crispy shrimp and flash-fried sprouts as apps.  Shrimp were something you can find anywhere (i.e. bonefish) but the fried sprouts were pretty tasty.  For dinner I had the fried local chicken and she had the salmon.  Her fish was good, but the underlying rice was super goopy and tasted like it was cooked in a crockpot with canned cream'o mushroom soup. My chicken had some excellent flavor but the bulk of my meat portion was just fried chicken skin with minimal actual meat.

The staff is friendly, attentive, and they make great recommendations. We were unsure on which wine to split and our waiter spoke openly about which was what we were looking for without clearly encouraging us to only go for the most expensive bottles.

The top deck has great string lights which makes for a great atmosphere. Inside cleanliness and decor are top notch. They find a great mix of casual and formal. Wearing a dress or wearing jeans and a nice top both work for the atmosphere.

The food. That alone earns the five stars. The lobster Mac and cheese came highly recommended and when I say they don't skimp they definitely don't. I split a dinner portion with my friend and we still couldn't finish it all. It comes topped with cheese and such large chunks of lobster we found ourselves cutting it into smaller portions so we could enjoy more noodles. Another friend ordered the steak frites and the portion size was amazing. The best part about all our selections despite the large size the flavor was there. Our cocktails were delightful strong but not overwhelming. We ordered a banana split with there house made ice cream. It was delicious and definitely a shareable dessert.

One friend I've gone with is vegan and our waiter recommended the local roasted squash without cheese and we all ended up nibbling it because it was delicious! I would recommend this place with fighting colors.",41.0,The Local,0.9938,Tuesday

Walking in to the restaurant you will notice local artwork and on the tables were these elegant glass candles. Almost looked as though they were handmade. 

We enjoyed the crab soup. It was a tomato based soup filled with plenty of crab. The Brussels and Cauliflower lightly seasoned and crispy, laid over a sirachi mayo sauce. Highly recommend them as an appetizer! 

My crab cakes and asparagus were a great choice. Highly recommended and would order again. I could do without the coleslaw! I am planning on returning to enjoy another delightful item on the menu!",20.0,The Local,0.9728,Friday

The second time was actually better than the first. They didn't have any tables but we sat at the bar which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. The bartender was absolutely amazing. He's very attentive even with having a bar full of customers. My boyfriend ended up not liking his drink, and he was super observant of this and offered him another drink So that my boyfriend had a drink that he enjoyed with his dinner. He made sure our glasses were always refilled, and brought our food to us promptly. We both ended up getting steak, mine was absolutely amazing and tender.

617,2020-03-02,4.0,"After looking into a few restaurants for my friend's birthday dinner in Charlottesville, we decided on The Local. When you walk in, you were welcomed into a restaurant with a cozy and calm ambience, complimented with a wooden floor and brick wall interior to create a ""homey feeling."" We were seated upstairs, which ended up being more spacious than we expected. For a Saturday night, this place was packed. It seemed to be a more family oriented restaurant based on the patrons this evening.

For the food, we decided to split the Fried Brussels and Cauliflower. Although the waitress recommended we get two, one plate was more than enough for the five of us. The cauliflower was cooked to perfection, but the brussels were not as tender as I expected. Also, there was flavor in this starter, I think there needed to be a counterpoint to it given it was just had a sharp tangy taste that lacked any sort of spice. 

Our entree orders: The Ceasar Salad was fairly standard, but the Goat Cheese salad was the perfect mix of ingredients created a sweet yet savory salad experience. Both had the right amount of dressing to not oversaturate the greens. Amazing pick. Another great option was the Gnocchi Bolognese. The gnocchi were melt in your mouth pillows saturated in a creamy meat sauce. The Truffle Mushroom Ragout was also drenched in creamy flavor, although it was a little bland (but to be expected based on the simple ingredients). The Veggie Burger, also fairly delicious, came with a whole appetizer size portion of burrata- it was incredible. The Duck Breast was incredibly succelent, and the only issue was that of the appetizier- the lack of tenderness in the brussel sprouts. 

As a tip, a couple of us just got the salads and a half portion of pasta thinking we might still be hungry, but honestly this amount was plenty and very cost effective.

All in all, you really get what you paid for here, as we all had some leftover food but were pretty stuffed towards the end of the meal. The waiters were attentive and helpful as well since we were new to the area/ restaurant and had a few questions while ordering. But, for the food, nothing really reinvented the wheel, but everything we got was solid so I have no complaints whatsoever.",122.0,The Local,0.9945,Monday
618,2020-05-29,5.0,"Update: If you're looking for good quality food made from local ingredients and that supports the community, highly recommend ordering curbside pickup from the Local!

The curbside set up is well-run - you call when you drive up and someone with gloves and mask will drop it into your car. 

Our favorite has been the mushroom pasta (we ordered it twice!); it is a nice blend of savory, buttery goodness. The fried chicken was not too heavily breaded, and the grilled hamburger steak was just a tad bit too salty for me. The 2 dishes came with mashed potatoes and green beans.

I cannot say enough good things about our experience.

First of all, there were 13 of us, and we had one server, who knocked it out of the park. She was amazing, patient, and accommodating! She made several recommendations, one of which I took for my meal. I ordered the gnocchi bolognese and it was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.

The pork chop was the unanimous favorite amongst all the plates. Each bite had a little fat with it to make it tasty, and I loved that it came with a big fat bone to gnaw on.

I loved the art on the walls, they were so fun to look at. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. The service is quick, even when they're super busy! You should definitely make a reservation (it was somewhat difficult for us to get a spot).

Food/drinks breakdown:
-Mariposa 10/10: such a yummy cocktail, really enjoyed the flavors
-Farmer's Tan 8/10: a really pretty color, but I didn't really love the taste
-Crab Soup 9/10: very delicious!
-Fresh Burrata 10/10: loved all these flavors! Highly recommend this for an appetizer
-Beef Tenderloin 9/10: this was one of their specials, and it was so delicious! I really enjoyed their flavors and it was all cooked perfectly
-Local ""River Oaks Farm"" Chicken 8/10: the chicken was amazing- I'd give the chicken alone a 10/10. The mac and cheese was a delicious complement to it. I didn't enjoy the collard greens- they used some spice that made it sweet, which I wasn't expecting and didn't really enjoy, but other than that the plate was great!
-New York Style Cheesecake 9/10: I really enjoyed this! The hazelnut crust was especially amazing.

The inside of the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere with warm lighting and exposed brick. I also love how the interior supports local artist's paintings and stain glass works.

We ordered Crispy Shrimp Appetizer, Sauvignon Blanc, Meatloaf, Gnocchi Bolognese, and House Made Blackberry Cobbler. The Crispy Shrimp was lightly fried, cooked well, and tasted great in the sauces. The seaweed salad that came with it also complimented the dish nicely.

The Gnocchi was perfectly cooked and had a nice bite to it. The sauce was hearty, and the overall dish was delicious. The Meatloaf was awesome. The bacon was a nice touch, and it was one of the best meatloafs I've ever had. The mashed potatoes and green beans were also cooked well. It's a great meat and potatoes dish. The entrees we ordered were 17 dollars each and I thought the portions and quality were great for the price.

For dessert, we tried the House Made Blackberry Cobbler. It was probably the most underwhelming order of the night; however, it wasn't bad. I would have liked a nicer crust on the top and bottom because I couldn't really find any crust. I also would have liked the blackberry filling to be thicker because the consistency was more on the liquid side with solid pieces of blackberry sitting inside. However, I thought the vanilla ice cream was good and it was freshly made which I liked.

Overall, I enjoyed my food and dining experience here. I love how The Local embodies their namesake as a locally owned business that sources ingredients from locally owned and operated farms, and even showcases local artists in their restaurant design.

634,2021-08-19,5.0,"I took the recommendations of the restaurant employees and ordered the shrimp appetizer with seaweed salad ($12) and the salmon ($23) as my entree. Being from Florida, I wasn't quite sure about ordering all seafood at an inland location, but the restaurant really delivered a delicious meal. The shrimp is fried in a light batter and the salmon has a wonderful crust. Overcooked seafood can be so disappointing, but the salmon was cooked perfectly. The fish flaked while still having moisture, a perfect medium rare salmon, just the way I like it. Salmon is such a wonderful fish, but over cooking it just a bit can transform its flavor from being delicate to very fishy and strong. So kudos to the chef, because not only was my piece cooked perfectly, so was the second order I took home . The restaurant is cozy and has a lot of outdoor seating, mostly shaded. Definitely going to be a regular spot for me in the coming years. A good place to go when family comes to visit!

Our only somewhat critical comment was that we initially got seated in the wine barn next to the main restaurant but it was very cold due to the doors keeping opening, and it was clearly mostly meant for groups - there were 2 parties of 8+ sitting inches from our table - that the ambiance was awful. Their loud laughing and cheers-ing did not make for a date night ambiance like we were hoping for, and made us feel like intruders to the parties. Luckily, we asked our initial server if we could move to another table elsewhere and he was very accommodating and quickly moved us to a great table in the main restaurant area next to the bar.

The restaurant itself is beautiful, styled with local art available for purchase. The standout here to me was actually the service! The host and server were incredibly friendly and helpful, answering questions and accommodating special requests -- we ordered the cheese plate with breads separate for a gluten allergy and they made sure to do that and warn us about any contact allergens for other menu items. I really felt welcomed by them. 

The cocktails were also quite excellent. We ordered a few to try, but the Death in the Afternoon was a must-order (for lovers of Absinthe). The .38 Special was excellent as well.  

For appetizers we sampled a few, the fried brussels sprouts had to be the best. If you come here, make sure you order that. The cheese plate was really great as well, with a good selection of local cheeses. 

We ordered a variety of entrees as well, everything from the seafood pasta to the burger to the steak. Everything was tasty, the steak and salmon being especially well received. We ended the meal with a peanut butter brownie, which was rich and enough to share with all five of us after all the other ordering we did!

The one drawback with this restaurant is that it is pricey. It was a really fun place to go splurge for a special occasion -- birthday dinner for us -- but maybe not the spot for a general meal.

Came here on Mother's Day-first I'd like to commend the front of house staff on managing a crowded front door right at 5 pm opening. Also would like to recognize Christian for outstanding service and thorough knowledge of the menu. I went with the local burger, and took a risk ordering it med rare. But lo and behold, they nailed it! Tender and juicy without being undercooked. Also would recommend the meatloaf-cooked to perfection, and that's coming from someone who's not the biggest meatloaf fan!

We ordered the local cheese board, the crab soup, the steak frites, and their famous meatloaf. We loved everything we got, especially the entrees. The meatloaf had a deliciously spicy and complex glaze, and the artichoke bechamel sauce served with the steak was rich and buttery. Also, the portions were very generous.

As we walked out, one of the waiters practically chased us down and offered us a table outside.

658,2022-07-26,5.0,"My new favorite spot in Charlottesville. First impression is the location of the restaurant itself--it resembles a super small town and it certainly feels like you're visiting somewhere with tons of history.

The Food:
*.38 Cocktail - I love whiskey and old fashioned's and this one certainly impressed. I'm not a fan of ginger (one of the ingredients), but whatever they did with this drink it certainly worked. Highly recommended.

*crispy shrimp - great and tasty appetizer. If you love Asian food and flavors, then you'll likely love this one. The seaweed salad was unexpectedly very tasty.

*pork belly - This was good and had plenty of flavor but I'd warn anyone who isn't a fan of meat with a fatty cut. There was a bit too much for my wife's liking but we still enjoyed it.

*Buffalo Creek Beef short ribs - Loved it and it's as good as everyone says it is. Tender, flavorful, and filling! If you are considering it, go ahead and order it. 

*Tenderloin - This was an item on the special menu that night and my wife enjoyed every bite. The portion size was also impressive and she was defeated by it.

Overall the food was standard, maybe a little upscale and pricey but I had a great time. Servers were very polite and attentive. 

Brussels/Cauliflower- oven roasted with a nice pepper aioli 

Fried Chicken- came with pimento cheese mac n cheese and I subbed the greens for green beans. The mac n cheese actually tasted like pimento. Very tasty. The chicken had a nice juicy inside with a good crunch outside.

665,2022-11-30,4.0,"Well, this appears to be one hoppin place in the Vancouver downtown area. I chose it because it was walking distance from the Hilton and it was open late.

Sat at the bar and had a bean dish topped with an egg and what I believe was a Cajun style sausage. It was delicious! It had some spices I couldn't quite identify but it was really good. I would put it in the comfort food category. The portion was not large (not small but I hadn't eaten all day) so I also ordered the side dish of carrots.

The carrots may have been the best I ever tried! They were grilled with some type of nut and a thin sauce that was delicious. Also very pretty multi colors of carrots. If you come here you have to try them.

Service was attentive and friendly- I was alone so I ate at the bar.

The only downside is that the wine was a little disappointing- I wish I would have went with beer as it appeared they had a much better selection.

They also have a very extensive selection of mixed drinks and spirits. I tried an old fashioned but I was also a little disappointed with that. The bartender noticed and didn't charge me. Even so, this is an expensive place if you drink, although I thought the food was reasonable for the area.

The Low Down:

Call ahead early for a reservation. The tables on the front right side are going to be close to the host or hostess. Try to sit closer towards the back or over to the left to avoid hearing their conversations with guests during your dinner.

The food: it's made with locally grown produce and is very fresh.

-My cocktail glass was under filled (especially for $13)
-Appetizer (cheese board) was more basic than expected and had greens/lettuce as filler
-Entrees were overdone and on the bland side
-Dessert was missing a component listed on the menu
 Each part just felt lackluster and overall missing extra flavor and intention/thoughtfulness. Not a bad restaurant for decent, casual food and very nice service, but it's not the place for a fun/special occasion experience that feels well crafted despite what its website appears to claim.

My preference would be to sit upstairs, which seemed less crowded, but still had exposed brick and wood.  Let's get to the food:  ample portions, deliciously prepared.

The trout dish offered two large fillets, surrounded by crispy crawfish over top of greens...collards I believe.

The portions were incredibly small for the set price that doesn't even include drinks. The steak was extremely well done and unseasoned despite the sauce on top that was bitter.

The cheesecake on the outside looked sort of like plastic- indicating it had been sitting out for a while before being served. I left hungry and unsatisfied unfortunately.

698,2023-11-27,3.0,"Eh.  Certainly not the worst dinner I've had but when the Local stacks up against other New American fare in Charlottesville it doesn't quite hold up in comparison. 3/5

TLDR the food is fine but not the best I've had here. If you're looking for ~$20 per person entrees for a decent night out you'll find it, but better and similar fare can be found at other spots around town.

The service and the ambiance are both good, it's very cute inside and old wood and bricks. The building is historic and it's well curated with local art. Tables are far too close together we were basically sitting on top of the people behind us and that was uncomfortable. Dining room was way too cold in the winter -bring a jacket.

The start we had a cheese and fruit plate. The cheese was pretty boring IMO - Brie, smoked Gouda, and then two white cheeses probably a cheddar and Parmesan. Fruit was grapes and apples. Good, but again kind of just meh.

For entrees, we had two pasta dishes at our table and two meat entrees. I had the shrimp carbonara, my friend had the truffle mushroom linguine, my boyfriend had the meatloaf (recommended by our server) and my friends boyfriend had the steak. All of us felt very meh - there was no standout dish everything was kind of just meh.

My shrimp carbonara was okay, the pasta was the star. It was perfectly cooked and the pasta tasted handmade. The shrimp half was tail on half was tail off and it felt cooked unevenly - some pieces were cooked too long and super curled and rubbery, some pieces were juicier. The sauce was a letdown - for a carbonara, this was like eating cheese water. Thin and very little flavor. I did not finish it and didn't bother taking more home. Not the best pasta in Charlottesville. This was the second dish our server recommended.

My boyfriend had the first recommended dish by our server, the meatloaf. It was wrapped in bacon atop mashed potato's and green beans. He said the green beans were slightly undercooked without much flavor but the mashed potato's were good. Meatloaf was good but could've used more sauce.

My friends mushroom pasta smelled delicious - she had similar takeaways about her pasta that I did of mine. Good pasta, but lacking in some flavor and thin sauce. Good, but not great.

Her boyfriend ordered a medium steak and this was definitely a disappointment. Let's just be honest - this steak was rare. He said the sides were good but the steak being undercooked and under seasoned was a let down considering it was a pricier item.

Beer was good, selection is decent.

Dessert was good we had peanut butter brownie w ice cream and a pecan pie. Very average but still good.

Overall I didn't feel like anything really stood out to me except the prices - C&O, Orzo and the Ridley, even Mockingbird all kinda have similar fare to the Local with some minor variations but all do a better job than the local with everything except price. Everywhere else charges about $30+ per person so I was happy we paid a little less but would've been willing to pay more for better food.

Overall the local is good but not great - personally Charlottesville restaurant scene is so competitive I would probably look elsewhere in the future for New American fare.",249.0,The Local,0.9985,Monday

Our meals (short ribs, pork chop and shrimp appetizer) were cooked beautifully and served promptly. We made some special requests that were graciously accommodated. Our food was full of flavor and served piping hot.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our server Justin. He was charming, informative and attentive without hovering. He asked right away if either of us were avoiding any ingredients. We explained that my husband is allergic to shellfish. It was so nice having a server ask that question up front. His recommendations were spot-on.

The Local is small and has a cozy feel to it.  We had reservations and were seated right away.  We had a big lunch and were looking for something on the lighter/small side.  The menu gave us plenty of options.

We started with the Local Cheese Board.  It has Parmesan, Bleu, Brie, Swiss and Goat cheeses with apples and grapes.  Perfect with our wine.

With both did salads as entrees and I added the crab cake appetizer.  My wife wasn't crazy about here salad as the dressing had molasses in it.  I tried it and liked.  I enjoyed my house salad, they include pickled onions and cucumbers in it.  The crab cake was perfect.

I can't comment about their entrees, but the food we ate was very good.

On the downside, the service started off good, but got a little slower.  The place was busy but not packed.  Also, the chairs are very uncomfortable.

The proteins both were a tad dry but overall, solid/good taste, like I said for the price and the service, not too shabby!

710,2024-08-04,3.0,"One experience at the Local, and it looks like this:

Early reservations got us a table in a satellite space next to the main dining room, which looks like their wine cellar. Bare brick and wine bins were the vibe, with a server station tucked away in a corner. Tables were a little tight, which makes the place cacophonous when there's a large well-served six-top seated in the corner (ask me how we found out).

The menu was comfort-heavy from an entree standpoint (everyone ordered either steak frites or the braised short ribs, although there were three different gnocchi offerings). The apps were equally easy to choose from: we grabbed a cheese plate and the burrata caprese salad. The cheeses were fine, four large cubes of various white cheeses and a little round ball of chèvre. Plenty of grapes, cut apples, and box crackers made this a decent little appetizer value for four. The caprese offering was a great way to bring forth the current burrata trend by plating it on top of large sliced tomatoes over arugula, with a lace of a balsamic reduction all over the top.

The steak frites was passable, fries served on the side in a little bistro basket. The steak was played on top of a horseradish-artichoke bechamel  (I was so stoked for this, but alas, literally, weak sauce: thin, no sense of horseradish bite at all). To be fair: not sure if this is a case of incorrect expectation versus execution. It wasn't bad, just not sure what I got. The short rib was a nice long-braised short rib over a decent mashed potatoes: easy, accessible.

The wine list at the Local is simply lovely. We were seated right beside all of the several vintages of Stag's Leap: they are not playing around when it comes to wine. The by-the-glass list is simple, accessible, and affordable. 

All in all, the Local fit the bill for a family dinner out. It's comfortable food and wine that hits the table really quickly (we were in and out in less than an hour), and has something for everyone.",115.0,The Local,0.9733,Sunday
711,2024-08-13,5.0,"Went on a Monday night - they have half price wines by the bottle anything under $75.  The server told us over but they gladly honored the price of our wine.  The food was good - pictured is what I had.  The salad was good (maybe a few too many fried wontons) but nice flavor and not overdressed.  The rockfish was delicious but strangely served in a bowl which made it virtuously impossible to eat - cutting it became impossible and I had to ask for a plate.  They brought me a tiny side plate which didn't improve matters much.  Everyone else enjoyed their entrees  - crab soup, buratta special, steak frites, meatloaf, and fried gnocchi with scallops.  I'd definitely go again and would recommending this local spot.",60.0,The Local,0.9884,Tuesday

The food was also really good - we had the cheese plate and Brussels/cauliflower to start which were big sizes to share. For meals we all had a variety of things, but I had the short ribs the first night and the salmon the second night - each tasty, and a nice portion size. For dessert I had a peach cobbler which was okay, but the chocolate cake was fantastic!

Boy, did it work out well! Parking was tough, but after a few times around the neighborhood we found something. It's a happening area with lots of restaurants, so not a surprise. While walking over, we could smell some awesomeness. It's a very hip and historic place inside, and they make great use of the space in an old storefront. They were really busy, but we didn't have to wait even though we didn't have a reservation. Our server was awesome and gave us some time to choose between some difficult choices. I knew right away I wanted the she-crab bisque, and it was delicious. For my entree, there were a number of things that looked amazing, but I decided on the braised short ribs. They came on some tasty mashed potatoes, along with pearl onions and a mini carrot. The meat was perfectly cooked in red wine, and amazingly tender.

They allowed my friends to select a set menu with a variety of options for only $50 per person, this did not include alcohol. For a four course meal the price and good was great. The mushroom risotto was amazing as was the lobster macaroni and cheese for starters! The salad was even great and I'm pretty indifferent to most Restaurants house salads.

Relative to other restaurants in Charlottesville, I think the Local has the best pricing for awesome food. - all in all, a PERFECT semi-formal DATE SPOT. Even affordable for a college student trying to do something a bit more fancy for a night.

FOOD: fresh and sourced locally! Hence this place's name. I think they've truly perfected the flavors here. Of what I've tried, the pork chops are great as are the roasted cauliflower and their steak. Their berry cobbler dessert is delicious as well. The fact that I've been here 3 times and have enjoyed my dishes every single time gives this place a 100% in my books.

SERVICE: So kind and so knowledgeable! I forget my servers name but everyone around us commented how awesome he was and their desire to tip him well. - white guy with brown curly hair!

AMBIANCE: Cute, cozy, and also great outdoor seating if you so wish. Their back area has a cool painting of birds as well.

I've had everything from the trout and burgers to steak and short ribs and food is always hot, fresh, and very well seasoned and flavored. 

One of the best things about this place is that there is so much ample space! It's absolutely great for large, large parties and there a ton of starter platters that can be made to share. 

It's a bit pricey to be eating here regularly, and the semi-formal vibe makes it difficult to justify as an easy option for dinner.

I had a house salad which was unique with pickles onions and an Asian flair, and the salmon, which was baller. The big cous cous was delicious and the green beans were flavored well too.

The only reason I'm deducting a star is because our waitress acted super weird when the majority of us ordered pasta instead of entrees. She goes ""you guys and your pasta!

I've been here two times, the first being on a date. We both ordered pasta and it didn't disappoint. The second time being here was my birthday. The fries that came with my father's steak were delicious (I began to poach them after my meal was finished) and I personally got the glazed pork chops, which came out succulent and delicious.

Each time I've gone, I've made a reservation on Open Table and was seated right away. I definitely recommend making a reservation if you're going from Friday to Sunday.

Atmosphere - I love the ambiance. The downstairs is sort of a classic wooden rustic bar area, and the upstairs is more of an open concept fancier restaurant with twinkle lights. If you have any family or friends visiting from out of town, this is a perfect place to take them for a nice, but casual night out with dinner and drinks.

Service - The service has always been super quick and the wait staff is extremely attentive, even when it's a busy Friday or weekend night.

Parking - There's not much parking in front, but there is a neighborhood on the parallel street over with ample amounts of street parking.

Most importantly, FOOD - I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't eat much meat. I LOVE their Truffled Mushroom Ragout. It's so creamy and rich without being too heavy. I usually get the double/larger portion so that I can take it home and have it for leftovers the next day for lunch!

The Local reminded us of many of the higher end places around town (Oakhardt, Duners, Orzo, etc), except the food was certainly a small step down from those place BUT the prices were also noticeably lower.  Cheaper 'date night' prices, pretty solid food, super close and convenient.... overall Local is worth trying out. 

We followed the waiter's recommendations and got the crispy shrimp and flash-fried sprouts as apps.  Shrimp were something you can find anywhere (i.e. bonefish) but the fried sprouts were pretty tasty.  For dinner I had the fried local chicken and she had the salmon.  Her fish was good, but the underlying rice was super goopy and tasted like it was cooked in a crockpot with canned cream'o mushroom soup. My chicken had some excellent flavor but the bulk of my meat portion was just fried chicken skin with minimal actual meat. We also had a side of Gus but with only 6 spears for $6... you'll want to skip those. Lastly, our server was friendly but kinda hard to understand b/c he worked&talked at the speed of light.

The staff is friendly, attentive, and they make great recommendations. We were unsure on which wine to split and our waiter spoke openly about which was what we were looking for without clearly encouraging us to only go for the most expensive bottles.

The top deck has great string lights which makes for a great atmosphere. Inside cleanliness and decor are top notch. They find a great mix of casual and formal. Wearing a dress or wearing jeans and a nice top both work for the atmosphere.

The food. That alone earns the five stars. The lobster Mac and cheese came highly recommended and when I say they don't skimp they definitely don't. I split a dinner portion with my friend and we still couldn't finish it all. It comes topped with cheese and such large chunks of lobster we found ourselves cutting it into smaller portions so we could enjoy more noodles. Another friend ordered the steak frites and the portion size was amazing. The best part about all our selections despite the large size the flavor was there. Our cocktails were delightful strong but not overwhelming. We ordered a banana split with there house made ice cream. It was delicious and definitely a shareable dessert.

We enjoyed the crab soup. It was a tomato based soup filled with plenty of crab. The Brussels and Cauliflower lightly seasoned and crispy, laid over a sirachi mayo sauce. Highly recommend them as an appetizer!

When you walk in, you were welcomed into a restaurant with a cozy and calm ambience, complimented with a wooden floor and brick wall interior to create a ""homey feeling."" We were seated upstairs, which ended up being more spacious than we expected. For a Saturday night, this place was packed. It seemed to be a more family oriented restaurant based on the patrons this evening.

For the food, we decided to split the Fried Brussels and Cauliflower. Although the waitress recommended we get two, one plate was more than enough for the five of us. The cauliflower was cooked to perfection, but the brussels were not as tender as I expected. Also, there was flavor in this starter, I think there needed to be a counterpoint to it given it was just had a sharp tangy taste that lacked any sort of spice. 

Our entree orders: The Ceasar Salad was fairly standard, but the Goat Cheese salad was the perfect mix of ingredients created a sweet yet savory salad experience. Both had the right amount of dressing to not oversaturate the greens. Amazing pick. Another great option was the Gnocchi Bolognese. The gnocchi were melt in your mouth pillows saturated in a creamy meat sauce. The Truffle Mushroom Ragout was also drenched in creamy flavor, although it was a little bland (but to be expected based on the simple ingredients). The Veggie Burger, also fairly delicious, came with a whole appetizer size portion of burrata- it was incredible. The Duck Breast was incredibly succelent, and the only issue was that of the appetizier- the lack of tenderness in the brussel sprouts. 

As a tip, a couple of us just got the salads and a half portion of pasta thinking we might still be hungry, but honestly this amount was plenty and very cost effective.

All in all, you really get what you paid for here, as we all had some leftover food but were pretty stuffed towards the end of the meal. The waiters were attentive and helpful as well since we were new to the area/ restaurant and had a few questions while ordering.

I cannot say enough good things about our experience.

First of all, there were 13 of us, and we had one server, who knocked it out of the park. She was amazing, patient, and accommodating! She made several recommendations, one of which I took for my meal. I ordered the gnocchi bolognese and it was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The portions were large and the flavor was even bigger. I enjoyed it so much.

-Farmer's Tan 8/10: a really pretty color, but I didn't really love the taste
-Crab Soup 9/10: very delicious!
-Fresh Burrata 10/10: loved all these flavors! Highly recommend this for an appetizer
-Beef Tenderloin 9/10: this was one of their specials, and it was so delicious! I really enjoyed their flavors and it was all cooked perfectly
-Local ""River Oaks Farm"" Chicken 8/10: the chicken was amazing- I'd give the chicken alone a 10/10. The mac and cheese was a delicious complement to it. I didn't enjoy the collard greens- they used some spice that made it sweet, which I wasn't expecting and didn't really enjoy, but other than that the plate was great!
-New York Style Cheesecake 9/10: I really enjoyed this! The hazelnut crust was especially amazing.

The inside of the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere with warm lighting and exposed brick. I also love how the interior supports local artist's paintings and stain glass works.

We ordered Crispy Shrimp Appetizer, Sauvignon Blanc, Meatloaf, Gnocchi Bolognese, and House Made Blackberry Cobbler. The Crispy Shrimp was lightly fried, cooked well, and tasted great in the sauces. The seaweed salad that came with it also complimented the dish nicely.

The Gnocchi was perfectly cooked and had a nice bite to it. The sauce was hearty, and the overall dish was delicious. The Meatloaf was awesome. The bacon was a nice touch, and it was one of the best meatloafs I've ever had. The mashed potatoes and green beans were also cooked well. It's a great meat and potatoes dish. The entrees we ordered were 17 dollars each and I thought the portions and quality were great for the price.

For dessert, we tried the House Made Blackberry Cobbler. It was probably the most underwhelming order of the night; however, it wasn't bad. I would have liked a nicer crust on the top and bottom because I couldn't really find any crust. I also would have liked the blackberry filling to be thicker because the consistency was more on the liquid side with solid pieces of blackberry sitting inside. However, I thought the vanilla ice cream was good and it was freshly made which I liked.

Overall, I enjoyed my food and dining experience here. I love how The Local embodies their namesake as a locally owned business that sources ingredients from locally owned and operated farms, and even showcases local artists in their restaurant design.

754,2021-08-19,5.0,"I took the recommendations of the restaurant employees and ordered the shrimp appetizer with seaweed salad ($12) and the salmon ($23) as my entree. Being from Florida, I wasn't quite sure about ordering all seafood at an inland location, but the restaurant really delivered a delicious meal. The shrimp is fried in a light batter and the salmon has a wonderful crust. Overcooked seafood can be so disappointing, but the salmon was cooked perfectly. The fish flaked while still having moisture, a perfect medium rare salmon, just the way I like it. Salmon is such a wonderful fish, but over cooking it just a bit can transform its flavor from being delicate to very fishy and strong. So kudos to the chef, because not only was my piece cooked perfectly, so was the second order I took home . The restaurant is cozy and has a lot of outdoor seating, mostly shaded. Definitely going to be a regular spot for me in the coming years. A good place to go when family comes to visit!

My entree was the Local fried chicken - which was tender & juicy & fell off the bone- with a bomb pimento cheese macaroni and flavorful collards. The hot sauce drizzle really made the plate.

Our server Stella was great- I'm a server as well and could tell she was clearly working so hard but still made an effort to take time with us and was very kind! 

Our only somewhat critical comment was that we initially got seated in the wine barn next to the main restaurant but it was very cold due to the doors keeping opening, and it was clearly mostly meant for groups - there were 2 parties of 8+ sitting inches from our table - that the ambiance was awful. Their loud laughing and cheers-ing did not make for a date night ambiance like we were hoping for, and made us feel like intruders to the parties. Luckily, we asked our initial server if we could move to another table elsewhere and he was very accommodating and quickly moved us to a great table in the main restaurant area next to the bar.

We finished the night off with the flourless chocolate cake which was good but I think we should have ordered something else (that's on us).

The restaurant itself is beautiful, styled with local art available for purchase. The standout here to me was actually the service! The host and server were incredibly friendly and helpful, answering questions and accommodating special requests -- we ordered the cheese plate with breads separate for a gluten allergy and they made sure to do that and warn us about any contact allergens for other menu items. I really felt welcomed by them. 

The cocktails were also quite excellent. We ordered a few to try, but the Death in the Afternoon was a must-order (for lovers of Absinthe). The .38 Special was excellent as well.  

For appetizers we sampled a few, the fried brussels sprouts had to be the best. If you come here, make sure you order that. The cheese plate was really great as well, with a good selection of local cheeses. 

We ordered a variety of entrees as well, everything from the seafood pasta to the burger to the steak. Everything was tasty, the steak and salmon being especially well received. We ended the meal with a peanut butter brownie, which was rich and enough to share with all five of us after all the other ordering we did!

The one drawback with this restaurant is that it is pricey. It was a really fun place to go splurge for a special occasion -- birthday dinner for us -- but maybe not the spot for a general meal.

The Food:
*.38 Cocktail - I love whiskey and old fashioned's and this one certainly impressed. I'm not a fan of ginger (one of the ingredients), but whatever they did with this drink it certainly worked. Highly recommended.

*crispy shrimp - great and tasty appetizer. If you love Asian food and flavors, then you'll likely love this one. The seaweed salad was unexpectedly very tasty.

*pork belly - This was good and had plenty of flavor but I'd warn anyone who isn't a fan of meat with a fatty cut. There was a bit too much for my wife's liking but we still enjoyed it.

*Buffalo Creek Beef short ribs - Loved it and it's as good as everyone says it is. Tender, flavorful, and filling! If you are considering it, go ahead and order it. 

*Tenderloin - This was an item on the special menu that night and my wife enjoyed every bite. The portion size was also impressive and she was defeated by it.

785,2022-11-30,4.0,"Well, this appears to be one hoppin place in the Vancouver downtown area. I chose it because it was walking distance from the Hilton and it was open late.

Sat at the bar and had a bean dish topped with an egg and what I believe was a Cajun style sausage. It was delicious! It had some spices I couldn't quite identify but it was really good. I would put it in the comfort food category. The portion was not large (not small but I hadn't eaten all day) so I also ordered the side dish of carrots.

The carrots may have been the best I ever tried! They were grilled with some type of nut and a thin sauce that was delicious. Also very pretty multi colors of carrots. If you come here you have to try them.

Service was attentive and friendly- I was alone so I ate at the bar.

The only downside is that the wine was a little disappointing- I wish I would have went with beer as it appeared they had a much better selection.

They also have a very extensive selection of mixed drinks and spirits. I tried an old fashioned but I was also a little disappointed with that. The bartender noticed and didn't charge me. Even so, this is an expensive place if you drink, although I thought the food was reasonable for the area.

Ambiance was pretty cool - had a selection of vinyl records playing a mix of genres. Loud but not too loud to converse.",106.0,Tavola,0.99,Wednesday

The Low Down:

Call ahead early for a reservation. The tables on the front right side are going to be close to the host or hostess. Try to sit closer towards the back or over to the left to avoid hearing their conversations with guests during your dinner.

The food: it's made with locally grown produce and is very fresh. 

The roast local squash was stuffed with cheese and oozing with flavor. This dish was devoured. 

The gnocchi bolognese had a creamier sauce- it worked really well with the cheese and hand made pasta.

791,2023-02-16,4.0,"Between a 3 and a 4 for The Local. Although nothing was outright bad about dinner here, it left a lot to be desired. Each part of the dinner wasn't quite right:
-My cocktail glass was under filled (especially for $13)
-Appetizer (cheese board) was more basic than expected and had greens/lettuce as filler
-Entrees were overdone and on the bland side
-Dessert was missing a component listed on the menu
 Each part just felt lackluster and overall missing extra flavor and intention/thoughtfulness. Not a bad restaurant for decent, casual food and very nice service, but it's not the place for a fun/special occasion experience that feels well crafted despite what its website appears to claim.

The portions were incredibly small for the set price that doesn't even include drinks. The steak was extremely well done and unseasoned despite the sauce on top that was bitter.

818,2023-11-27,3.0,"Eh.  Certainly not the worst dinner I've had but when the Local stacks up against other New American fare in Charlottesville it doesn't quite hold up in comparison. 3/5

TLDR the food is fine but not the best I've had here. If you're looking for ~$20 per person entrees for a decent night out you'll find it, but better and similar fare can be found at other spots around town.

The service and the ambiance are both good, it's very cute inside and old wood and bricks. The building is historic and it's well curated with local art. Tables are far too close together we were basically sitting on top of the people behind us and that was uncomfortable. Dining room was way too cold in the winter -bring a jacket.

The start we had a cheese and fruit plate. The cheese was pretty boring IMO - Brie, smoked Gouda, and then two white cheeses probably a cheddar and Parmesan. Fruit was grapes and apples. Good, but again kind of just meh.

For entrees, we had two pasta dishes at our table and two meat entrees. I had the shrimp carbonara, my friend had the truffle mushroom linguine, my boyfriend had the meatloaf (recommended by our server) and my friends boyfriend had the steak. All of us felt very meh - there was no standout dish everything was kind of just meh.

My shrimp carbonara was okay, the pasta was the star. It was perfectly cooked and the pasta tasted handmade. The shrimp half was tail on half was tail off and it felt cooked unevenly - some pieces were cooked too long and super curled and rubbery, some pieces were juicier. The sauce was a letdown - for a carbonara, this was like eating cheese water. Thin and very little flavor. I did not finish it and didn't bother taking more home. Not the best pasta in Charlottesville. This was the second dish our server recommended.

My boyfriend had the first recommended dish by our server, the meatloaf. It was wrapped in bacon atop mashed potato's and green beans. He said the green beans were slightly undercooked without much flavor but the mashed potato's were good. Meatloaf was good but could've used more sauce.

My friends mushroom pasta smelled delicious - she had similar takeaways about her pasta that I did of mine. Good pasta, but lacking in some flavor and thin sauce. Good, but not great.

Her boyfriend ordered a medium steak and this was definitely a disappointment. Let's just be honest - this steak was rare. He said the sides were good but the steak being undercooked and under seasoned was a let down considering it was a pricier item.

Beer was good, selection is decent.

Dessert was good we had peanut butter brownie w ice cream and a pecan pie. Very average but still good.

Overall I didn't feel like anything really stood out to me except the prices - C&O, Orzo and the Ridley, even Mockingbird all kinda have similar fare to the Local with some minor variations but all do a better job than the local with everything except price. Everywhere else charges about $30+ per person so I was happy we paid a little less but would've been willing to pay more for better food.

830,2024-08-04,3.0,"One experience at the Local, and it looks like this:

Early reservations got us a table in a satellite space next to the main dining room, which looks like their wine cellar. Bare brick and wine bins were the vibe, with a server station tucked away in a corner. Tables were a little tight, which makes the place cacophonous when there's a large well-served six-top seated in the corner (ask me how we found out).

The menu was comfort-heavy from an entree standpoint (everyone ordered either steak frites or the braised short ribs, although there were three different gnocchi offerings). The apps were equally easy to choose from: we grabbed a cheese plate and the burrata caprese salad. The cheeses were fine, four large cubes of various white cheeses and a little round ball of chèvre. Plenty of grapes, cut apples, and box crackers made this a decent little appetizer value for four. The caprese offering was a great way to bring forth the current burrata trend by plating it on top of large sliced tomatoes over arugula, with a lace of a balsamic reduction all over the top.

The steak frites was passable, fries served on the side in a little bistro basket. The steak was played on top of a horseradish-artichoke bechamel  (I was so stoked for this, but alas, literally, weak sauce: thin, no sense of horseradish bite at all). To be fair: not sure if this is a case of incorrect expectation versus execution. It wasn't bad, just not sure what I got. The short rib was a nice long-braised short rib over a decent mashed potatoes: easy, accessible.

The wine list at the Local is simply lovely. We were seated right beside all of the several vintages of Stag's Leap: they are not playing around when it comes to wine. The by-the-glass list is simple, accessible, and affordable. 

All in all, the Local fit the bill for a family dinner out. It's comfortable food and wine that hits the table really quickly (we were in and out in less than an hour), and has something for everyone.",115.0,Tavola,0.9733,Sunday

The food was good - pictured is what I had.  The salad was good (maybe a few too many fried wontons) but nice flavor and not overdressed.  The rockfish was delicious but strangely served in a bowl which made it virtuously impossible to eat - cutting it became impossible and I had to ask for a plate.  They brought me a tiny side plate which didn't improve matters much.  Everyone else enjoyed their entrees  - crab soup, buratta special, steak frites, meatloaf, and fried gnocchi with scallops.

For meals we all had a variety of things, but I had the short ribs the first night and the salmon the second night - each tasty, and a nice portion size.

I knew right away I wanted the she-crab bisque, and it was delicious. For my entree, there were a number of things that looked amazing, but I decided on the braised short ribs.

We tried a couple cheeses and meats from the charcuterie menu, nothing out of the ordinary, but prices were good at $3/serving. For entrees, we went with the mushroom pizza and the porchetta sandwich. The pizza was ok - crust was a little too doughy for me, and I wish the pizza had more garlic and less cream. Mushrooms were good and had great texture. The sandwich was pretty good - the porchetta was tasty, but there was too much broccoli rabe which overpowered if you got the wrong bite. Also, wish the bread would've been thicker as the sandwich fell apart it was so messy. The bread though was also really good, cooked in the wood burning pizza oven.

I've also tried their Cavoletti di Bruxelles, which is shaved brussels sprouts with chives, fennel, roasted hazelnuts, maple garum vinaigrette, pecorino. I was a bit disappointed with this because I thought the brussels sprouts would be cooked and warm, but it wasn't.

My fiancee took me here on my birthday at 5pm on Saturday and we had to wait for over 50 minutes. We first waited in the hall and ordered a drink, and then we finally made it over to the ""waiting"" room in the back, where we ordered another drink. The wait wasn't so bad as the cocktails really sweetened the deal. I really liked the Lampo Smash, the Hot Toddy wasn't my favorite. 

When we finally ordered, we got the classic neapolitan pizza, special salad, and fried donuts to top it off. 

The special salad had bold flavors with nutty farro, mozzarella cheese, pumpkin seeds, and pomegranate seeds. An eclectic combination that works well.  

The pizza was cooked well, but the best part of the meal was the cinnamon fried donuts. It really reminded me of funnel cake. I gobbled up all of the donuts and left one for my fiancee when he got back from the rest room (at least I left one!).

Thin crisp crust. A delivery vehicle for ingredients above. Anchovies floating on a briny sea of capery oil and light cheese and tomatoes. I'm a sucker for the hairy fish, and all umami. But the rest of the pizzas look equally fab. 

Start with a bowl of olives, some blue cheese and salami and plan your assault.

Alas, Lampo has been long 'discovered' so it's best to arrive at an off-hour, a blistering hot day, or with a bag of patience.

Side note, saw someone order a chop of some sort and it was massive and looked like the best hunk of meat I've ever scene at a mainly pizza spot.

The Funghi pizza was my favorite thanks to the garlicky panna cotta base.

When it's a nice day, sitting outside is ideal. 
Plenty of doggies outside. One of them was playing with a stick/root that was buried in the ground.

Abruzzo pizza is basically margherita with some meatballs on top and is a safe choice if you don't like venturing out of your comfort zone too much. 
I recommend getting there near opening time if possible, as they don't take reservations and do it by a paper waitlist! Sometimes they'll let you stand on the side and snag the bar seats if the waitlist party doesn't show up.",44.0,Lampo,0.9845,Monday

You can't make reservations here, but if there's a wait at dinner, it's well worth it. There's a full bar for a quick drink or glass of wine if you want to wait inside.

Was the food worth it? Yes. My 2 companions and I enjoyed salads, olives, drinks and two 12 inch pizzas that we completely demolished, the Abruzzo (with meatballs) and the Prosciutto (with arugula and prosciutto toppings). There was some heated discussion about who got the last piece!

858,2019-09-29,5.0,"The pizza here was amaaazing. I was working in the area for several weeks in a row during the summer of 2019, and my boss said I absolutely had to stop by here before I left. I almost didn't come because I was really intimidated by how small the space seemed to be and the lack of reservations, but I decided to take advantage of the fact that I was around on weeknights when the restaurant would (theoretically) be less packed.

I arrived at just before 7:30 PM on a Thursday evening, and the restaurant was very, very busy. I was seated immediately at the bar because I was dining solo and they happened to have that odd seat available, but if I had been in a group or even a couple, I would've had to wait. The restaurant is definitely very small and cramped, tables and bar seating included. Since I'm really petite, I would describe it as cozy, but I imagine anyone bigger than me might say it was uncomfortable. My end of the bar was also where the bartender set the drinks before the servers came around to take them out; I had a small space to set my wallet/pocketbook next to it. I was afraid it might be in the way, but no one said anything and all the staff seemed very adept at working in the small space.

I decided to order the pizza special of the day, which was a pizza with white anchovies and capers. It took a little while for the pizza to come out, but not unexpected given they were being made to order and the place was absolutely heaving. While I waited for my food, I had a very close view of the kitchen and was able to watch the kitchen staff very diligently stretch dough, sprinkle cheese on various orders, and load up their huge pizza oven. I felt like the huge pizza oven really added to the rustic and ""authentic"" atmosphere of the restaurant. It was also the star of the kitchen; everything from pizzas to meatball appetizers went in there.

I was so happy when my pizza came out, along with the ""scizzas"" to cut it up. The pizza was definitely one of my favorite things I ate during my time in Charlottesville. I've had pizzas in both Rome and small villages in Italy, and I would honestly say Lampo held its own even when compared to those. The anchovy and capers were super flavorful and the amazing dough complimented the toppings beautifully. I definitely inhaled my pizza because I didn't eat lunch in preparation for pigging out, but the portions are large enough that you could reasonably expect to take part of the pizza home with you, especially if you have appetizers to start.

For dessert, I was torn between the budino (chocolate pudding) and the zeppole (ricotta doughnuts). Normally, I think I would go for the zeppole because I'm a carb monster, and they looked very attractive when some of the tables around me ordered them. But I decided to go for the budino since it was more unique compared to my normal dessert options and I wanted to try something new. The pudding was delicious and the hazelnut brittle added a lovely texture. It was served with a layer of olive oil drizzled on top--I can't honestly say it added much to the flavor or texture of the dessert in my opinion, but I definitely wasn't against it.

The bartender was super friendly and quick to refill my water throughout the meal. At one point during the meal, one of the kitchen staff caught me making eyes at the pizza oven and seemed amused; he also asked how I liked my food after I'd finished my pizza. Everyone seemed very quick and efficient. For the quality of the food, I thought the prices were reasonable; this meal wound up being one of my pricier ones during my stay in Charlottesville, but I did get a lot of extras (dessert, a cappuccino), and I think if you came for just pizza, $16 for the size and quality of the pizza is really reasonable.

My experience might be helped by the fact that I didn't have to wait for a seat, but now that I've tasted the food, I think a 45-minute wait would've been worth it to me. I think that's something to be prepared for if you're coming here in the evenings, even during the week. When I left the restaurant around 8:30 PM, it was dark out, and couples were still putting their names down to be seated. The restaurant and its environs aren't much to look at from the outside, but the atmosphere is so warm and bustling on the inside.

I heard that before COVID-19, when people could dine inside, they serve your pizza and cut it with scissors. When I arrived in Charlottesville for my week-long getaway my friends started asking me if I've been to Lampo yet.

You can imagine the energy that was created towards Lampo at this point. The bar was raised even higher with some of the hurdles that came about before finally getting a pie. The odd Wednesday - Saturday hours meant I had to wait till halfway through the week to try it. After I ordered online I saw there was going to be a 90-minute wait til it would ready.

That's Chicago deep-dish level of preparation time here.

Don't worry, it was worth every single moment it to for me to get a pie.

It was indeed the freshest Neopolitan/Italian style pizza I've ever had.

I'm not a fan of red sauce on my pizza and seeing a pie that was more traditional with the little pieces of cheese spread out made me skeptical but I LOVED their robust tomato sauce. The little saucers of mozzarella were nothing less than amazing.

We had a 2+ hour wait for our food and when we arrived at the time indicated our food would be ready, we were met with hostility and passive aggressiveness. So we had a lighter skinned person in our group pick up the food to avoid more hostility. The server was incredibly nice and attentive to him.

We ordered on a Saturday and it did seem like it was a long wait, so plan ahead. On our popular night it was a two-hour wait, but they text you when to come pick it up. No worries, enjoy the Art House film on the building wall next door...
We got the margarita D.O.C., Abruzzo, Prosciutto. All were very good, but more along the style of thin crust. So check it out Tony, because they make a pizza offer you can't refuse.",268.0,Lampo,0.8772,Thursday

I got there about 30 mins after they opened and they were nearly packed already!  (So, get there early!)  The bartender was rather busy, not only handling service bar, but also the patrons at the bar.  He was friendly, but not very out going, possibly because he was just very busy.  They have an interesting menu loaded with unique pizzas and other dishes made on the stove or in the oven and everything is made to order.
I tried their bread first and it was really good and piping hot, as it just came out of the oven.  Next, I opted for their escarole and it was nicely sautéed with garlic, rather tasty.  I then opted for their meatball pizza and had them provide a side of Calabrian pepper oil for me to drizzle on my slices.  It was pretty good.  Dough was nice, a little rubbery, but nice overall.

The Margherita DOC is everything I want and more. The fungi is also a solid choice and I also peruse the specials menu for a fun change of pace. I love Lampo's crust because it's thin and yet so chewy. I sneak the crust with charred bits for extra flavor. Pro tip: save the leftover meatball sauce and dip the crust in it. 

Lastly, do not skip on the dessert. The chocolate pudding is so dreamy... I mean creamy. I love the sweet and crunchy candy bits that compliment the rich and slightly bitter chocolate. Truly the perfect finish to the best meal in Charlottesville.",337.0,Lampo,0.9967,Saturday

I came here with a friend one weekday evening. The place is kinda small so not good for groups. We sat at the 'bar' and could see the oven in the back. They have hooks underneath the counter to hang your belongings.

We ordered a pizza and each had a glass of red wine. Pizza and wine was amazing, but how long it took to get our pizza was not. It took about an hour for us to get the pizza and there really wasn't that many people eating in. But man was the pizza delicious. Fresh dough flavorful toppings. The wine pairing was phenomenal as well, one of the best I've had.

The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful in picking out what we wanted from the menu, and the food came wickedly fast. 

The brussels sprouts are a can't miss. The dressing is delicious and zesty, and the hazelnuts are the perfect complement. And of course, you can't go wrong simply dumping a pile of freshly grated parmesan on anything. The main event of course is the pizza. We tried two: the Margherita D.O.C. and the Prosciutto. The difference between the classic and the D.O.C. is in the cheese, the classic is the house mozzarella and the D.O.C. is imported straight from Italy. I am sure both are amazing, but the D.O.C. did have an unbeatable creamy and buttery texture that was perfect on the pizza. The Prosciutto was an incredible bite. The meyer lemon perfectly complemented the arugula and other ingredients. The staff brought over fresh parm and red pepper flakes as well, and that added a great kick.

And if you go here, do NOT miss the ricotta donuts. They are perfectly soft inside, with a delicious crunch. They're also served with meyer lemon, and that squeeze cuts through the richness to create a perfect bite. I swear, everything I ate here was better than the last.

When we arrived we were greeted and seated quickly right inside the door. The space is small yet vibrant and cozy and we immediately felt at home despite being from out of town. The pizza selection - all Neapolitan style, perfectly sized for yourself or sharing if you're generous - was delightful. A flavor profile and taste for every palette, with local and exotic farm-sourced ingredients. 
After ordering beautifully made cocktails (again with the most considerate ingredients and combinations), our pizzas arrived. While I don't recall the name of mine it was the ""spicy"" one, with a beautiful simple red sauce that was perfect, complete with amazing dollops of cheese and a beautiful chili oil to round out the flavor and texture. 
I love leftovers and I try to eat mindfully most of the time but all of that was out the window here because the pizza was THAT GOOD. I couldn't stop and ate the entire thing with pride. Perfectly flavored crust was cooked to perfection with salty blisters on the edge. The center was paper thin yet cooked and held the simple sauce and cheese perfectly, making you cradle it just so as you prepared for a bite. Slicing the pizza with the fun pizza scissors they give you was also a blast and something I've never done before!

We were in Charlottesville for 4 days and every day I wanted to go back here and sadly we were unable. I still think about this pizza often and crave it - that's how perfect it was! If it wasn't a 7 hr drive away, I'd be here every week.

We decided to split a pizza and a sandwich.  The muffaletta had good quality meats and cheeses. The flavors were on point, but the bread was a pita like style, and I don't think it helped the sandwich. The real star of the night is the pizza. The 5 start review is for the pizza. It was great! We had the standard margarita with scissors to cut it. The crust had the correct amount of char and was cooked to give it a nice chew. The quality of the ingredients was clearly on display.  Great sauce with bright tomato mixing with the creamy cheese. Just enough basil to add a little extra on those bites. It was very bright and left me wanting to order another for later. The place is small and seems to be a team effort for service. It was busy, and I think the service suffered a bit. They took our plates after the meatballs and stated she would return with clean ones, but that didn't happen. After dropping off the pizza and sandwhich, they didn't check in to ask about the food or even refill drinks. Maybe it was just an off night?",70.0,Lampo,0.9847,Sunday

I was lucky enough to live in Italy and fell in love with true thing Christ pizza that still has a chew to the crust.  Lampos more than met my expectations for what pizza should be - delicious texture on the crust, flavorful ingredients.  We enjoyed a nice bottle of red to accompany the meal.  I opted for the prosciutto pizza (mainly bc I love arugula on a pizza).  It was everything I was looking for and more - the lemon added a nice brightness to the taste.  We arrived at 5:30 and didn't have to wait as we snagged the last open table.  After that there was a wait but they serve drinks next door while you're waiting. The pizza was ready maybe 10 minutes after we ordered so you don't have to worry about waiting long once you're seated.  I want to go back and check out the fungi pizza next.

The pizza was amazing because I love mushrooms and the crust had the perfect pull and char.  That chop salad was equally delicious with absolutely no complaints.  I thought that I didn't have enough salad dressing, but it was the perfect amount actually.  

The donuts are a MUST try.  They look funny, but looks are deceiving.  I can't remember how many came with the order because I basically inhaled them.  They were a little crunchy on the outside with the cinnamon and sugar while super soft on the inside!  Delicious!  I don't want regular donuts anymore.  I want some more!.

We were visiting Charlottesville for the weekend and heard from multiple friends that we needed to check out this cozy little pizza spot - it absolutely didn't disappoint. The staff are very friendly (our waitress gave us some great recommendations for other spots to eat and explore), and the vibe is warm and inviting. 

Food-wise, we started with a small meat & cheese board (loved their homemade bread on that!) and the meatballs in pomodoro sauce (super flavorful and juicy), then we split the DOC Margherita pizza, which was absolutely perfect (chewy crust, deep flavor, extremely fresh, and fun to cut with pizza scissors). We ended with the chocolate pudding, which was surprisingly elevated and unique - the pudding was rich and had a sweet cream mixed in to tone it down a bit, then it was topped with hazelnuts and crunchy caramelized sugar... incredible.

944,2024-06-20,3.0,"I have waited several days to write this review to see if my disappointment has tempered and dissipated somewhat.  It has; I have decided to go from two stars to three.  

Our first taste of Lampo was when it opened ten years ago.  It was wonderful.  Lampo rivaled anything you could find in Brooklyn, LA or New York City that was modestly priced and of good quality.  The pizzas were superb.  The food was obviously prepared by individuals who loved their craft.  

Our recent experience in June of this year was the first one since the pandemic.  Not the same.  Ingredients still good by and large but the love is missing.  I should add that the staff was never really top notch.  Outside of Brooklyn, LA and the City you don't often find professional servers and that's the case at Lampo.  However, the food more than made up for it.  

I've seen this happen often.   Young, talented people initially motivated to bring quality to the dining experience soon flag after about seven  years because restaurant work is tough.  I know.  My family started our first pizzeria in 1951.  One of my first memories was going with my mother to Brooklyn to buy a Blodgett pizza oven.  (Wood-fired ovens were still in future in this country.)

On a positive note, I hope and think they can recover.  Take my advice: Don't let the crowds of ""thirty somethings"" fool you; they still go to Taco Bell.  Set your own standards, put your nose to the grind stone and make this your life.  There can be no compromise with good food and devotion to hard work.",3.0,Lampo,0.9824,Thursday

Second - we ordered the white mushroom pizza off the menu and it was very good - not great (could have used more toppings).  Unfortunately the third element was the porchetta sandwich- made with pizza dough, with very tasteful and well prepared broccoli rabe - but devoid of the namesake roasted pork!   Now it was a bit dark inside, so I could not see perfectly but the sandwich was essentially rabe and cheese - well flavored but some porchetta would have been a nice touch.  There probably were trace amounts..... but why just not rename the sandwich ""broccoli rabe with cheese"" and I would have ordered the meatballs

950,2024-08-29,3.0,"I will start by saying I really like Lampo. We try to hike up in Raphine once a year and we always stop at Lampo on our way back home to Chesapeake  - it has become a little tradition. 
We went yesterday and I was a bit disappointed.  
I'll start with service. Waitress was a bit cold.  Not very friendly. I usually don't care about that.  I go for the food and servers can have bad days. But when the food is off AND the service... then I mention it in the review. 
Now on to the food. 
The Margherita pizza is my favorite but this time had barely any cheese on it. I feel like I paid 19 dollars for sauce and bread. When I mentioned how the cheese was lacking, the waitress said "" I can bring you some grated cheese"". Not really what I was hoping for, but I said ok. 
To add insult to injury ... the bill came and I was charged 2 dollars for the grated cheese.  On top of the 19 dollar  ""sauce bread"". Really Lampo? Who does that??!! 
You serve pizza. Cheese comes with pizza!!! 
Not cool. 
The olives are also one of my favorite dishes. Ordered that too - no complaints there. The ginger beer was very refreshing. 
But the ending was the kicker. We asked for TWO separate checks. We were a party of three. Waitress told us it couldn't be done. But told us we could figure out who owed what and could use two separate cards for one bill. ( how is that any easier?) So now we had to pull out a calculator and itemize all our charges including the taxes and service charges and the added tip. 
I think after this experience we will be looking for a new ""after hike meal"" to add to our tradition.",15.0,Lampo,-0.7891,Thursday

While I arrived around opening, getting in was not a speedy process, and indeed it was a half hour past opening before I finally had a pizza (that spends ninety seconds in the oven), which matters because I was hungry from my hike.

However, an excellent shredded kale appetizer sated my hunger, and the quality was there. A DOC margherita, with imported buffalo mozzarella, was only a small increase in price from the basic one, and buffalo mozzarella is hard to find. The crust had a fine note of char, and was easily cut with their fancy pizza scissors.

This menu included a few other intriguing options and they do offer pizzas without cheese for those in need, but I was not disappointed that I picked the standard by which Neapolitan pizzas are judged, and you'd go a long way before you find another such pizza at this level of quality.",4152.0,Lampo,0.7376,Monday
